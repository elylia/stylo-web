And for [the] reason [proverbs] are oftentimes more mischievous than profitable.  The spirit of the vernacular mind may be distinguished by the maxims most in use, and these maxims, reversing the general order of things, are first effect, then cause--and this is the case with every opinion, and saying representing opinion, which is adopted, not discerned.   That which people repeat, as a clever saying, without understanding, for if they understood it would no longer be repetition, ends by becoming the type as much of opinion as such persons are capable of exhibiting.
	It would be well if considering [this] those in whose hands circumstances place the [smeared with ink]  mind were to reflect before they the parents of1            which may produce such obstinate offspring.  The most they can do is to tell us that mental food is to be had, and to point in the direction if the road we must take to reach it.  They cannot take us an inch on the road itself and the probability is that those who win profit by the direction would without such sign post, have found a path for themselves--and enjoyed the more from the fact while, all who never see any but its surface meaning would have been beter [sic] without possessing weapons which they know not how to handle.  For these reasons we always dislike to see a vol. of Proverbs, Maxims, Pensées or by whatever name they may designate those vade mecum’s for mental listlessness & unfounded assumption.
2A collection of veritable proverbs could never be perfected while there remained any new situation in which humanity could be placed every [phasis] of spiritual existence could not be perfected untill [sic] the last human being should expire.  When our volume would be but of little avail.  Yet some approach to such an universal Text book might be made were every person to inscribe the result of their life were it but a single sentance [sic], which they themselves had earnestly felt.  The Biography of many a human life might be like that of Thelka concentrated in a sentance [sic].  But what meaning there would be in those few words!  were they but the magic-words Life & Death there would be implied in them more than the whole sum of[,] the whole  journey, human mind has ever yet fathomed.  yet what a vocabulary does not that phrase imply--enjoyment extasy [sic]--happiness--suffering--struggle--hopelessness!  with the wide feilds [sic] on either side!--each being who has lived, for whatever the no. of years has that no. of years experience to profit by, and to relate for others profit would but each relate it honestly.
