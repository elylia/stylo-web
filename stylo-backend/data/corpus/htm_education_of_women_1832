Much has been said & written on this subject--and perhaps all that is to be said or written--but reiteration is the grand secret of popular impression.  The saying being true in that connexion [sic], that where ten steps will reach the goal, nine steps take us half way.
	Our inquiring is not so much of how much they should learn, or how little they do learn--but of the prior question to what is it proposed they sd learn at all?  Is the end desired to make us better ministrants to the pleasures of men and if so to what description of pleasure are they to produce or increase[.]  On the answer to these questions will depend the solution of the next--is the object of educating them the production of the greatest amount of happiness themselves of which they are capable 
	By what strange process is it that the end talked of is always happiness or pleasure to men--true that is one of the ends proposed--but only by implication in the theory that the greatest happiness of each being accords well with the greatest happiness of all.  We hear nought of in disquisition on mens [sic] education of what sort of instruction will produce the greatest happiness [for] women.  We hear of no profession of the act of making women happy, yet with the utmost gravity--this art appears as the ultimatum of [grace] and learned.
