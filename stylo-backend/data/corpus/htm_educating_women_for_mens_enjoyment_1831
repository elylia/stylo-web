Notwithstanding the somewhat sarcastic tone, which we think in a measure marred the value, of the otherwise satisfactory & well-timed article, entitled a Political & social anomalyâ€™,1 in the last number of this work it was calculated to do much good by fixing the attention of the unthinking on a fact & displaying in a manner which those interested in maintaining error could refuse to admit the injustice & absurdity which that fact implies.  
	So far is well--and would suffice, if the anomaly there set forth were the only one, or the greatest, in the social condition of women.  But it is not so--their deprivation of a civil existence is only one page in the chapter of womens2 degradation,--and that Chapter is the fullest & the first in the heavy vol. of social discontent and human unhappiness. Would that men saw how infallibly the mental frustration of the guide of his childhood[,] the companion of his manhood must re-act on their own condition the degradation of his mental & moral being & even to the diminution of those merely physical enjoyments which he falsely imagines to be purchased by her. 
3[M]uch has always been said by those among men & women too[,] who[,] sayers rather than thinkers[,] about educating women for their sphere, suiting them for domestic duties, & so forth--all which sayings are of most self-evident & undeniable truth--but which by those who use them are meant4 to imply much more than is said.  The meaning in the mind of an ignorant person using the phrase educating women for domestic duties--is something of this.
	The very fact, indisputable as it is, that this description of enjoyment is in almost every instance a purchase is at once a proof & a result of the5            of both sexes.  Let me not be mis-understood [sic] when I speak of purchase--that is not less a purchase whose payment is a home, an establishment, a reputation even, than that for which money is counted out--nay even to this last exess of degradation do 3/4 of our adult male population[.] 
	[A]las for the hopes of the regeneration of a community in which such a state of things excites no disgust.
	We wd say[,] is the greatest [happiness] of the greatest no., the greatest happiness of each consistent with the happiness of others[,] a desirable & virtuo[u]s aim?  this being granted[,] as who can deny--the next question is[,] do women attain, in the position in which they now occupy in society the fullest development of the mental & physical capalities [sic] with which nature has endowed them?  We can imagine no obtusity equal to the notion that they do so--if they do not then do they not attain their greatest capability nor their greatest happiness, which we are already admitted to be the most virtuo[u]s aim of a human[.]
	[W]e6 shall perhaps startle many people when we say that we thing [sic] the system of separating the sexes during childhood is a radically mistaken one--it induces a mystery in the feeling of the sexes towards each other, which being allowed, not by percept yet in practice free scope for its solution in the boy, while by the girl so much of it as is natural to a woman must not be mentioned not even thought of.
