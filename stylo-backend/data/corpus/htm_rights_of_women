It is in vain to work at small & selfish changes nothing will refine & elevate the lower classes but the elevation of women to perfect equality.  It is just in proportion as women are practically thoâ€™ not legally treated as equals that men are refined & spiritualised; therefore the higher classes are the most so, altho their most defective education makes this advantage not tell for what it might in their circumstances.  In the present state of the world & of opinion marriage as an institution can not fail to degrade & keep down the moral character of the people if it is subjected to two radical changes, namely, that it shd be made a real contract between equals--that the two persons shd each possess their own pecuniary means or earnings free from any power of the other--& that it shd be dissoluble upon either of the parties desiring it during a sufficiently long period.
