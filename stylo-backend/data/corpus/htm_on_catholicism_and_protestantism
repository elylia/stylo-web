Now the old religion has the monopoly of all the terms repressive of & associated with spiritual & elevated ideas
---------
	Equality as a principle & feeling can only come from the cultivation of spiritual ideas upon a different basis from what are now called religious doctrines.
	There have existed & appear to be, but two forms of spiritual ideas--the Catholic, & the Protestant.  Protestantism undertakes to evolve all spirituality from the understanding as a basis.  The principle of Catholicism, precisely opposed to this, wholly omits the understanding from its means of spiritual elevation.  It seems to me that the two forms divide between them what should constitute the true basis of religion[.]
	The object both of Catholicism & of Protestantism is the elevation of the moral nature.  Catholics succeed up to a certain point in educating the moral through the sensual.  Protestants fail in teaching the moral through the understanding.  I believe because they attempt to commence where the Catholics leave off, without passing through that elementary education which the Catholics give.
