Art. X.: THE BALLOT.—A DIALOGUE.
Speakers:—a Farmer—a Schoolmaster—a Squire.*

FARMER.—
You two are of opposite opinions, upon a subject in which I am interested. I wish to be in the right in my opinion; and you would do me the greatest favour if you would, each of you, state the reasons upon which his persuasion is grounded. When I have considered them together, I may, perhaps, discern which are the strongest.


Squire.—
Let us know the subject about which you are perplexed.


Far.—
The subject I mean is the ballot. You know I have recently had the power of voting for a member of parliament conferred upon me. But, as the tenant of another man, I am to such a degree dependent, that I must vote as he desires me.


Sq.—
Why so? Why not maintain the spirit of an Englishman, and vote as your conscience directs you?


Far.—
It is easy, as I have often seen, for all of us to make light of another man’s burdens. But, Sir, it is no small difference to such a man as me, whether he has the good, or the ill will of his landlord. In fact, the happiness or misery of his life may depend upon it. He may be forced from a spot on which he has planted himself, and from which he cannot be Edition: current; Page: [202] torn, without loss of property, and painful feelings, to any degree. Even if he is secured against removal, the state of a farmer, assured of all sorts of good offices from his landlord, and those about him, is very different from that of one assured of all sorts of ill offices from them.


Sq.—
But a high-minded man will vindicate his liberty for all that.


Schoolmaster.—
You say right, Sir; and it is very desirable that there should be as many high-minded men as possible. That, however, is not the only question; and wise legislation takes care to embrace all the questions involved in the consideration of its measures. True, it is desirable that there should be high-minded men; but is it not desirable that your institutions should not be such as to punish men for their high-mindedness? Are such institutions calculated to encourage the growth of this desirable thing?


Sq.—
But I desire to know how you make it out that our institutions punish high-mindedness.


Sch.—
I think you will allow that the amount of evil just described to us by our friend the farmer, is no trifle.


Sq.—
Certainly not; and I deplore it as much as you do.


Sch.—
But a lot of evil attached to the doing of an act, is punishment for that act, is it not?


Sq.—
No doubt.


Sch.—
A lot of evil attached to the act of voting in a certain way is, therefore, punishment for that act?


Sq.—
It is.


Sch.—
The man who acts—that is, votes, in this particular way—in obedience, I mean, to his conscience, but disobedience to his landlord, performs the high-minded act you applaud?


Sq.—
He does.


Sch.—
And, when the lot of evil follows, he is punished for it?


Sq.—
Yes.


Sch.—
A line of acting, established by law, in a concern of the public, and for a public end, is an institution—is it not?


Sq.—
It is.


Sch.—
Here then is an institution which punishes the farmer, and the very large class of men placed in corresponding circumstances, for a high-minded act.


Sq.—
I cannot deny that it is so.


Sch.—
And you do not, I am sure, maintain that it is right?


Sq.—
Far from it; but still it may be the least of two evils; and submission to it on that account may still be a duty.


Sch.—
Is not this a supposition which may easily be made? Edition: current; Page: [203] And does it deserve any regard, till that greater evil is pointed out, and its consequence, upon the removal of the less evil, proved to be inevitable?


Sq.—
Certainly not.


Sch.—
It is required of you, therefore, if you would entitle your position to any regard, to do both things—to show us the consequent evil, and to show that the consequence is certain.


Sq.—
I do not think it will be difficult to comply with your conditions. In the first place, I think it can be shown that your plan for rescuing the high-minded voter from the punishment attached to his vote will be unavailing. I also think, if it were rendered availing, that the consequences of the remedy would be worse than the disease.


Far.—
Ay, now you are coming to that which I am impatient to hear—whether I can be delivered from my thraldom? And if not, why?


Sch.—
Yes; you and I now wait for the reasons of the Squire; and, first, he has promised to inform us, why the ballot cannot afford you protection.


Sq.—
You will acknowledge that the efficacy of the ballot depends upon the secrecy.


Sch.—
True; because we consider the ballot a short name for secret voting.


Sq.—
But the ballot will be ineffectual for secrecy; because the same power which would compel the man, voting openly, to vote against his inclination, will compel him to tell how he has voted.


Sch.—
Oh, no; it may compel him to say how he has voted, not to tell. That is a very different thing; and whether he says, or tells, his compeller can never know.


Sq.—
Cannot he make him, in the very act of voting, show how he votes?


Sch.—
No; there is an effectual mode of preventing that.


Sq.—
How?


Sch.—
The voter may vote in a place where there are no witnesses, and in a way in which it can be known to no creature but himself how he has voted.


Sq.—
I do not understand your plan. Explain it more particularly.


Sch.—
May not the voter be admitted into a room, where he can be seen by nobody?


Sq.—
Certainly he may.


Sch.—
In that room there may be receptacles for the voting-balls or tickets intended for each of the candidates. Into Edition: current; Page: [204] which of these receptacles the voter has put his balls or tickets is utterly unknown, except to himself.


Sq.—
That, it appears, I must admit; but the compulsion to tell how he has voted may still be exercised.


Sch.—
What you mean is, that the man who has power over him may ask him how he has voted, and will punish him if he do not say that he has voted as he bid him.


Sq.—
Yes, that is what I mean.


Sch.—
Let us suppose that he does so; and what then? The voter either tells him the truth, or he does not. What is he benefited? He knows no more how the man has voted, in consequence of what he has told him, than what the emperor of China dreamt last night.


Sq.—
But still he knows, if the man has not voted as he bid him, the man has lied.


Sch.—
And pray, Sir, who is the cause of that lie? to whom of course the criminality of it ought to be imputed. But this part of the question—the collateral effects of the ballot—we had better, I think, consider afterwards, when we have first determined whether it will, or will not, afford a remedy for the evil against which we desire to provide it: in short, whether it will protect the voter from that process we have just described, of compelling a voter to vote dishonestly.


Sq.—
True, Sir, if it is not a remedy which will answer its end, it is needless to discuss its other properties, since it will not be desired.


Sch.—
You have admitted, I think, that the act of voting may be rendered perfectly secret; and also that, though the voter may say he has voted as his master has ordered, his master is not, by that circumstance, one jot the nearer a knowledge of how he has voted. His vote is still a secret to his master—and so, unless there are other circumstances to reveal it, must it ever remain.


Sq.—
I find myself constrained to allow that.


Sch.—
And so will all fair controvertists. The question, then, is, are there other circumstances to reveal it?


Sq.—
Yes; there is an article just published in the ‘Edinburgh Review,’ and said to come from a high quarter, which affirms that there are undoubted means of discovery.


Sch.—
Well, Sir, what are they?


Sq.—
The Reviewer says, that the voter’s general opinions are always known, from which his mode of voting will be inferred.


Sch.—
That is one circumstance: is there any other?


Sq.—
Let me think. It did appear to me, when I read the Edition: current; Page: [205] article, that there was a list of them; but I confess I cannot recollect another.


Sch.—
There is no other; though, as you say, the language used in the article implies that the assertion is well supported.


Sq.—
Do you mean to say, then, that I have been deceived by language either wholly or partially begging the question?


Sch.—
You compel me to smile. Do you not know that this is the master-piece of the rhetorical art? This circumstance, however,—this something, which is, by its sole operation, to discover the vote of the dependent, must be examined; that we may, of our own knowledge, not from the assertion of the reviewer, judge what it can, and what it cannot, make known.


Sq.—
That I join with you in desiring.


Sch.—
Let us suppose the case of our friend, the Farmer here, and his landlord. The Farmer is a known reformer. His landlord is an enemy of reform. Let the candidates be two—one a reformer, another an enemy of all reform. How does the landlord proceed? He denounces vengeance against those of his tenants who do not vote for his friend; and he will, says the ‘Edinburgh Review,’ go upon the rule, that all his tenants who are reformers will vote against him.


Far.—
But pray, gentlemen, consider a little in what condition I am to be placed by the operation of such a rule.


Sch.—
What is it you apprehend?


Far.—
The consequence will be the same to me, whether I vote with my landlord, or against him: in either case he will conclude that I have voted against him. But if I shall be concluded to have voted agreeably to my own sentiments, whether I have done so or not, what you have justly called the punishment of my vote will fall upon me, do what I will. Of course I shall, in these circumstances, give the vote which pleases myself, and my landlord makes my opposition to him sure. I am punished, but my landlord is disappointed.


Sq.—
That consequence is very clear; and the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ has anticipated the objection. He says, that such of their tenants as have sentiments they consider opposed to the vote they desire, the landlord will keep from voting at all.


Sch.—
I see that the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ lays great stress upon the exercise of this forbidding power possessed by the landlords. It is necessary, therefore, to consider carefully both what it implies, and what it can accomplish. One thing which it implies deserves to be accurately noted: it is no less than the important point, which not a few have had the boldness to deny, that for the purpose of secrecy the ballot is perfectly Edition: current; Page: [206] efficient. It is only because the landlord cannot know how his tenant will vote, that he deprives himself of his vote, of course fearing that it will be given against him; for if he had the means of knowing the vote, the same force which enables him to keep his tenant from voting, would enable him to make him vote as he pleased.


Sq.—
I do not see how that can be disputed. There would be no motive for making a voter stay away, if you knew and could command his vote if he went.


Sch.—
We are then to consider this as a conceded and established point, that the motive to keep dependents from voting arises entirely from the perfect secrecy of the vote.
Another thing which this argument implies is, an assurance that the power which great men possess to prevent the exercise of free voting will be generally used. This only deserves remark, as an instance of the inconsistencies in which the gentlemen of counsel against the ballot are involved. When the purpose is, to deny that there is any occasion for the ballot, it is commonly assumed, that gentlemen will not use their powers of coercion, but generously indulge their dependents in voting as they please; and we are called upon somewhat imperiously to wait, before calling for the ballot, till we see what their behaviour is. When the occasion, however, comes to maintain the inefficacy of the ballot, let the need for it be what it may, we are then told, with the loudest voice, that every man who has the power will exert it, even to the utmost: no mention now of the propriety of waiting, to see whether men grasping at political power will avail themselves of all their advantages for attaining it. Can the men who thus profess contradictory opinions upon the same subject—one opinion to-day, another to-morrow, as it suits their purposes—call upon us for belief in their sincerity?


Sq.—
I object to this inference; and I think that candour should have restrained you from expressing it. I allow the contradiction; but I can declare that till now I was not aware of it; and held both opinions in sincerity—both that it was doubtful whether the conduct of men of local influence would be such as to call for the ballot, and certain that they would exert themselves to defeat the ballot.


Sch.—
I am grateful for your rebuke, and feel its justice. I ought to have made more allowance for the oversights into which we are all apt to be led by the heat of controversy. You will, however, allow that those people who refute themselves—that is, who hold two opinions, the one of which destroys the other—are either somewhat careless in scanning their opinions, or not very capable of that most important intellectual process.

Edition: current; Page: [207]

Sq.—
You now charge the deficiency to the proper account—to the intellectual, not to the moral part of the offender; but I think that you are still guilty of an overcharge; it being, in my opinion, not very difficult for a man even of good intellect to overlook a contradiction or two in a number of allegations upon a complicated subject.


Sch.—
You will allow, however, that to make this apology available, the party must not persevere in his self-contradiction. If he does, it not merely argues, it proves, a sad deficiency in him somewhere. But this is leading us from the question. We have to inquire what the power of a great man, or combination of great men, in forbidding their dependents to vote, can do for them? If it should appear that it must be altogether inefficient for the attainment of their ends, do you think that it will then be a good argument against the ballot?


Sq.—
Certainly not; but I go upon the supposition that it will be efficient; and then I think it a good argument.


Sch.—
First of all, does it not deserve some consideration, what appearance it will have to the public, and what conclusions it will suggest, if it shall be demonstrated, by notorious facts, that a great proportion of the Englishmen to whom the law gives the right of voting are debarred from the exercise of that right, because they hold such and such opinions? Is that a state of things which could continue to exist?


Sq.—
I do not think that it could.


Sch.—
Is it not, therefore, either puerile or unfair to produce, as an objection to the ballot, a state of things which cannot exist?


Sq.—
I see that the argument would be of very little avail, if you can show how the evil is to be remedied.


Sch.—
You have allowed that it is a state of things, the permanence of which is not to be supposed—that it would certainly be put an end to.


Sq.—
I think it would.


Sch.—
Whether it be put an end to by what you would call a remedy, or a disease, does not affect the argument. A state of things which cannot exist cannot be urged as an objection to the ballot.


Sq.—
Yes, if getting rid of it would only introduce a greater evil.


Sch.—
That greater evil, then, would be the real objection, and should alone be urged. What is this evil?


Sq.—
That is what we have now, I think, to inquire. For my part, I do not see my way out of the difficulty. The ‘Edinburgh Review’ seems to think that no enactment of the legislature will Edition: current; Page: [208] be sufficient to deprive great landlords of the power of preventing their tenants and tradesmen from voting.


Sch.—
You are willing, then, to go with me into a close inspection of the subject?


Sq.—
Most willing.


Sch.—
There is one mode of delivery from the irrational and unseemly spectacle of a power conferred by the will of the community, through its supreme organ, on a portion of the community, and that power taken away, that is, the law broken and frustrated, by the will of certain individuals: namely, by repealing the law, taking away that power, which the will of individuals, too powerful for the law, renders nominal.


Sq.—
Do you mean, that all that description of voters whom the landlords would withhold from voting should be deprived of their votes?


Sch.—
Yes.


Sq.—
And have you considered that this would be to select out of the most numerous class of voters—namely, the poorest class—all those who hold sentiments favourable to reform—that is, the far greater proportion—and to deprive them of the power of voting, on the sole ground of their holding reform sentiments? Why, that would be to make a fundamental law of the state, for the express purpose of preventing reform for ever after.


Sch.—
It would be so.


Sq.—
And do you think that such a proposition would ever be listened to?


Sch.—
I do not; and therefore I think we may leave that proposition, as one sure not to be acted upon. But then, if we are to have these men with their votes, what are we to do for them? We see what the difficulty with them arises from: the source of it is, the power which certain men have over them. We must, then, work upon that power. Is there no means by which this power can be prevented from operating to the defeat of a fundamental end and purpose of the state?


Sq.—
The ‘Edinburgh Review’ seems to think not. Are you of a different opinion?


Sch.—
I am of opinion that the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ did not very deliberately weigh the consequence of his opinion; which is only this, that the existence of large properties must be destroyed, and prohibited for ever.


Sq.—
How say you? That, a consequence of the reviewer’s opinion?


Sch.—
You cannot doubt it. The votes of these men are, by the supposition, necessary to good government. Such is the opinion of the legislature, and of the community, who gave Edition: current; Page: [209] them their votes. The power of the landlords destroys this essential condition of good government. Good government and the power of the landlords cannot exist together, if the opinion of the reviewer is true. What the community have then to determine is, which is best for them, that they should have good government without great landlords, or bad government with them.


Sq.—
That is not a question which we can suppose they will be long in determining. But what would you do in that case?


Sch.—
The proper course is easy to be seen. As their power arises from the greatness of their properties, all great properties must be broken down into small ones; distributed, if you will, to the next of kin of the original owners.


Sq.—
I am staggered with this objection, and astonished that the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ did not see what his doctrine would lead to. It is no light matter to hold up, from such a quarter, a representation, from which it may be legitimately inferred, that the existence of large properties in a certain number of hands is utterly incompatible with the existence of good government. Let us, however, see whether he has not a defence. We remember that he is arguing against the ballot; and may he not say, that though you prove such and such consequences will flow from your endeavours to protect the ballot, such consequences cannot be pleaded against him because he wishes not to have the ballot?


Sch.—
It is only necessary to call to recollection the course of the preceding argument, to see how untenable is that plea.


Sq.—
Let us observe.


Sch.—
From the very proper terms in which the reviewer spoke, in the early part of the review, of the success with which the votes of individuals had been interfered with, both by reward and intimidation—both by money in hand and loss in prospect, it is clearly his opinion, that such interference (I mean to any considerable extent) is incompatible with good government. The same, undoubtedly, is the sole basis on which, in reason, the late reform can be defended; the object of which was by Lord Grey declared, in a pointed and admirably-chosen expression, to be representation—not nomination: meaning, by nomination, command of votes, either by bribery or intimidation. This, to be sure, is a ground which an opponent of the reform bill may reject; but it can never be renounced by any of its supporters, least of all by the ‘Edinburgh Review.’ The next point of admission on the part of the reviewer is, that the great proprietors have the power, and will have the will, to exercise both bribery and intimidation: so far, we agree with Edition: current; Page: [210] him. He says, it is not in the power of legislation to prevent them. By way of parenthesis, we should then ask him, what was the use of last year’s reform? But to pass that, we meet him here, and we say that the ballot would prevent them. This he denies, and skilfully states a train of reasons, such as they are, to show us we are deluded. Now, then, let us observe the upshot of our opposite reasonings. About the cause of the evil we are both agreed: it is the power—that is, the great properties—of the landlords. We say that the ballot will prevent the noxious exercise of this power; the reviewer denies that it will. But an efficient barrier against the introduction of good government must be removed. What follows I need not desire you to say. The question clearly is—ballot, or the destruction of large properties. If the ballot is sufficient to protect voting, as I believe it is, leave property to its natural course of accumulation or dispersion; if the ballot is not sufficient, the power of commanding votes must be taken away. For it is useless to mince the matter: good government we will not consent to be without. If the opposers of the ballot prove to us that with the existence of large estates we cannot have good government—in other words, pure representation—why then large estates must be abolished; the alternative is clear.


Sq.—
The impression made upon me by your reasoning is complex, and somewhat difficult to describe. I cannot easily reconcile myself to your conclusion; and yet if it were proved to the community that they cannot have the benefit of genuine representation, that is, cannot have good government, while the property of the country is placed in great masses in particular hands, nobody can overlook the consequence. The community will assuredly come to the resolution of breaking up these masses, and making all properties small. Nor can anybody deny that they will have reason for such a proceeding. But still are you not alarmed at the idea of such a state of things?


Sch.—
I know not what great evils I should apprehend from it. The moment of any considerable change is always ticklish. But I do not see why a community, in which there are a great many small properties, and none very large, should not be a very happy community. Many things might be said in praise of such a state of society, if it were now the object to recommend it. At present, however, I have no such design, because I think the ballot an antidote against the noxious exercise of the power of the rich; and if so, I desire not to meddle with their property. When it ceases to be hurtful, it ceases to be obnoxious to me.


Sq.—
But how are you to get over the objection, that voters may be forbidden to vote?

Edition: current; Page: [211]

Sch.—
That must be examined. The objection is given in broad, general terms, which afford no distinct ideas, and only leave behind them an impression that there is something of importance under them. Impressions of this sort are always a legitimate object of distrust, till the causes of them are minutely examined. Let us put before ourselves the circumstances, the combination of which, we are told, will defeat the ballot.


Far.—
That part of the inquiry comes home to me. I am eager to learn what protection can be afforded to the men of my class.


Sch.—
I wish to simplify the state of the question as much as possible. I shall suppose, therefore, that the distinction is solely that of reformer, and no reformer: the landlords forbidding the reformers to vote, and compelling the anti-reformers to do so. If they can do this, anti-reform candidates will alone be chosen.
We must bear in mind that the objection we are endeavouring to obviate supposes, that the majority of the farmers composing this or that constituency are reformers. If the majority were anti-reformers, the anti-reforming candidate would be chosen without the intimidation process of the landlords.
Now then, let us observe the natural working of this state of things. The landlords, says the objection, order the majority of their tenants to abstain from voting.
First of all, how are they to select their men? How do they know who are the reformers, who the anti-reformers? The answer must be, by their talk. The men who are known to hold anti-reform talk will be sent; those who hold the language of reformers will be kept away.
Talk then is the criterion; but talk is fallacious. The men who are the least likely to hold themselves bound by any promise to a landlord which they can break with impunity are precisely the men who are most likely to deceive him by holding language which he may hear of, though it be not the language of their thoughts. He may, upon this evidence, be sending men to the poll, the majority of whom will vote against him. That this is a probable result, is proved by this fact, that when there is a majority of farmers warm in a particular opinion, it is always a very large majority; as a body they think according to one another; those among them who stand by themselves in an opinion are always a small number.
So much for the success of the anti-reform expedient with those who are sent to the poll. In the meantime, what are the thoughts of those who are forbidden to poll? They know by being forbidden that they are marked men in the minds of their landlords. They are also men who have little regarded this Edition: current; Page: [212] circumstance, since it has not hindered them from speaking their minds. Are they not men, therefore, who may go a step further, and ask themselves what other danger they are to undergo, if they disobey their landlord and vote in spite of his prohibition? Remember that they are the majority. There is no danger that the landlords will turn off the majority of their tenants. A general resolution, then, among the reforming tenants, to disregard the interdiction, would leave the landlords without a resource. The landlords are now in a situation in which the loss of a single tenant is no trifle; that of a great number a calamity. The landlords have already proceeded so far in misconduct to their tenants, that they have deterred the resort of capital to their land. Can they forbear to see how much it is their interest to encourage, to induce, men of property, and men of intellect, to become their tenants? But can they hope to have such men for tenants, if they are not to be as independent and free, in their thoughts, words, and actions, as their landlords themselves? To have a servile, mean-spirited tenantry, they must have a starving, poverty-stricken tenantry, and not half a rent. Nothing is more obviously the interest of the owners of the land, than to have an opulent tenantry. But a tenantry, independent in their circumstances, will also be independent in mind, and hold in scorn a landlord who should presume to interfere with their votes.


Far.—
You have delighted me by this last exposition. I see that we have not much to fear from the expedient of the landlords forbidding us to vote.


Sq.—
I do think that this objection is answered. Not only is the state of things which it implies so revolting, that no man can suppose it would be tolerated; but if it were tolerated, we thus see that the landlords would be the sufferers. Still it appears to me that the question is not decided; the remaining arguments of the reviewer render the utility of the ballot more than doubtful.


Sch.—
You remember that we are still considering the ballot with regard to one part of its effects, its efficacy, or inefficacy, to protect the voter from punishment for an honest vote. If it produces ill effects of any other sort to counterbalance this effect, this is to be another inquiry. Therefore, we had better not as yet use the word utility in the discussion, as it may lead our thoughts to the result of both inquiries, when we ought to be thinking only of one.


Sq.—
Agreed. The next of the reviewer’s objections to the efficacy of the ballot, is, if I remember, drawn from the hourly returns made under the present system of polling. The men Edition: current; Page: [213] who vote within a certain hour, are so many. Their names are all known, and not so many as not to afford good ground of conjecturing who has voted one way and who another.


Sch.—
This is one of the modes, in which, according to the reviewer, the ballot will be defeated; and it is surprising that he should have committed so great an oversight. The hourly returns are an incident of open voting, and would be thoroughly excluded from secret voting. The balloting boxes would remain securely locked till the end of the poll, and the final return, that is the only one, would tell nothing but the numbers.


Sq.—
The reviewer, however, urges, and I think with reason, that the man of power would possess effectual means of intimidation, even if secrecy were fully secured by the ballot.


Far.—
Indeed! how does he make that appear?


Sq.—
He says, that he would select certain victims, inflicting a blow on one farmer which would strike terror into all the rest.


Sch.—
Let us take the facts as he would have us understand them. Let us suppose the anti-reforming landlords defeated; and that each of them has made his number of victims; that they have struck all the terror they can, and that a new election arrives. In what manner will each voter reason with himself? If the election goes against my landlord, says the man, some one in ten or twenty of us will be turned out. That to me would be a great calamity. How am I to conduct myself? Go, and vote for my landlord? That will not save me; because he may still suppose that I have voted against him. Shall I make great displays of zeal for his cause? He may still suppose that these are only a colour to disguise my opposition. I have no better chance if I vote for him than against him; then why should I not vote as I please? And after all, it is ten to one, or twenty to one, if any harm comes to me.—Is not this a very natural course of reasoning? And does not the reviewer, in his zeal to make out a case, invert a known law of human nature?


Sq.—
To what law do you allude?


Sch.—
That by which we over-rate the chances of good fortune; under-rate those of evil. Instead of seeing that every man, under the operation of this law, would believe, to a degree far beyond the actual probabilities of the case, that he would not be the victim, but escape safe, he would have us believe the contrary, that every man would look upon himself as the victim: as if it were the fact that every soldier, on going into a battle, believed that he was one of the men to fall: as if the direct contrary were not perfectly ascertained; and that the bravery of the mass of all armies depends upon that common illusion. Trust me, Sir, the selection of victims would not answer the Edition: current; Page: [214] intimidator’s purpose; and, accordingly, the reviewer, as if he saw that it would not, concludes, at last, that it would only operate with the voter as a motive to abstain from voting. But I am not much afraid of those who abstain from voting. The man who has courage to disregard the bidding of his landlord, will not be long without the courage to disregard his forbidding.


Sq.—
You dispose, Sir, of the objections of the reviewer, so easily, that I cannot but think there is more in them than your mode of showing them up permits to appear; though I do not find myself prepared to say what it is.


Sch.—
I perfectly understand the state of your mind. You are under the influence of habit, which all at once is never overcome. Your habit has been to suppose that there was something strong in those objections, without seeking to know distinctly what it was: and when it comes unexpectedly to be shown to you, that there is nothing strong in them, you cannot resist the reasoning, but the habit remains, and still produces a hankering to believe, what yet you have seen ought not to be believed.


Sq.—
This certainly does look like a description of what I feel.


Sch.—
In considering the effects which would be produced by any device of the great proprietors to reap the benefits of intimidation under the ballot, one of them is never to be forgotten: the situation in which it would place the intimidators among their fellow-countrymen. Suppose the owners of large properties to be guilty of some signal act of oppression (it must be severe to produce its effect) upon a proportion, say a tenth, or even a twentieth of their tenants, selected by caprice, and without evidence even of the honourable act of which they are condemned; would not the indignation of the community be excited? Would not such men be regarded as the sworn enemies of their fellow-citizens? Could men the object of such feelings, in such a country as this, be long suffered to hold the power of which they make so offensive a use?


Sq.—
I think, indeed, it is a state of things which would not last. But there is still an allegation more of the reviewer, to show that intimidation would exist in spite of the ballot. He says, that the ballot could only be effectual in a country where all the people were for it. If not, the people who despise secrecy would make an ostentatious parade of their mode of voting, and would thus reveal the secret of those who wish their votes to be concealed.


Sch.—
I think that this is the same objection, only in a new shape, which we have had before, and have disposed of. We began Edition: current; Page: [215] with supposing that there would be people who would declare beforehand their resolution of voting in a particular way; and would say afterwards that they had so voted. But we showed how these declarations of theirs could be rendered void, incapable absolutely of giving information, and of no more effect than so many inarticulate sounds. The reviewer supposes that these declarations would be accompanied with gaudy shews; with ribbons, and colours, and marrow-bones and cleavers. But what is all this to the purpose? Is it anything but profession still? and a noisy, or glaring profession, is just as likely to be false as a quieter one.
I think we have now gone through the reviewer’s budget of devices, by which the man of large property will, he thinks, in spite of the ballot, command votes by intimidation: and I think we have ascertained that they are impotent every one; that the ballot may be looked to, not only as a great security, but as a security to this purpose wanting little of perfection. The reviewer, however thinks, that not only great men, but little men, may intimidate; and it is fit we should consider what we have to apprehend from that source likewise.


Sq.—
I remember what you allude to. He says, that in towns (he confines the operation of this infirmity of the ballot to towns) combinations of the people, as by political unions, may be able to operate irresistibly on the fears of electors.


Sch.—
How can that be if the voting is secret? Combinations only threaten evil to those who vote against them; but when voting is secret, they do not know who votes for, or who votes against them.


Sq.—
The reviewer supposes that they will judge by the result.


Sch.—
Be it so. But what does the result teach them? Only that such a number voted on the one side, such a number on the other.


Sq.—
But what if they are exasperated with the result, and desire to take vengeance?


Sch.—
Vague anticipations of evil from a source which offers specific good, never weigh much with any reasonable men. Let us inquire what this decree of vengeance is to do. It is not to be supposed that the combinations in question act like madmen, and run a-muck at electors indiscriminately. Their vengeance will point only at those who have opposed them. But who has opposed them? That is buried in impenetrable darkness. Next it is to be supposed that these combiners are under the coercion of the law; and that even the individuals at whom their vengeance is pointed are safe from all violence: the combiners will Edition: current; Page: [216] only divert their custom from them. But why withdraw custom from one man more than another, when you cannot know that any man rather than another has voted contrary to your wish?


Sq.—
It appears then to be your opinion that the ballot would be a security against intimidation?


Sch.—
If you have nothing further to advance against that conclusion. For I think we have sufficiently shown, that the causes which, according to you and the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review,’ would obstruct the salutary operation of the ballot, are all of them inefficient; in fact, powerless to that mischievous end. Secrecy of voting, in the first place, which you said was not to be effected, has appeared to be the easiest thing in the world; secrecy so perfect, that not any declaration of the voter himself can by possibility disclose it. Next, the knowledge of an elector’s general opinions, we have seen, affords no effective means to the landlord. His order to stay away will assuredly be disregarded, because he has no means of punishing the breach of it; and if his vengeance after defeat strikes at a few victims, the intimidation is inadequate, and the disrepute extreme; the loss of political consequence greater than the increase of it which he aims at, and aims in vain. As for the approximation to a knowledge of the votes by the hourly returns, we take away the hourly returns; and the vengeance of clubs and combinations of the most numerous class of the people, is clearly and most indisputably precluded by the secrecy. I think, therefore, we may affirm with assurance, that the power of intimidation is taken away by the ballot, and that the independence of voters would be secured by it.


Sq.—
I am obliged to confess that the resources of the intimidator, under the operation of the ballot, appear, from what you have said, to be very weak in comparison with what I have been accustomed to suppose, and with what they are given out to be by the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review;’ who, I suppose, has written under that same hankering, which you ascribed to me, a hankering to believe—as he has been in the habit of believing—that the means of eluding the ballot are strong.


Sch.—
I have no doubt of it. But then he is a man who has the tutelary habit in such perfection, if the same who is commonly alluded to, I mean the habit of obeying the stronger evidence when it is found to bear even upon a fostered opinion, that he will soon get the better of the hankering.


Sq.—
The good effects of the ballot, that is, honest voting, may be nullified by two means, either by intimidation, or bribery: the latter we have not yet considered. But I see the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ lays great stress upon it in Edition: current; Page: [217] proof of his first position, that the ballot is an institution feeble, or rather impotent, to the production of good.


Sch.—
He does lay stress upon it, but in the way of rhetoric rather than argument. What he says is in truth an argument, not against the ballot, but against small constituencies, which his argument proves ought not to exist. In that conclusion I agree with him; if an imperfection of this kind is found in the constituency created by the Reform Bill, it must be, and that speedily, amended. There is no doubt that you may have a constituency so small as to destroy the influence of the ballot; but it is obvious, on the slightest reflection, that all the means alleged by the reviewer of gaining anything by bribery under the ballot, confine themselves to small constituencies, and can have no operation in large ones.
First, bribing voters to stay away, is only resorted to at the end of a hard contest, when it is known that a few votes more or less will decide the question; and when it is worth a man’s while to bribe highly. But take the state of things which ought to be made to exist,—a large constituency, and, from the beginning to the end, absolute ignorance of the state of the poll; who, in that case, can tell whether bribing one hundred or two hundred will be of any use? And who will throw away his money for such uncertainty? The absurdity of the supposition is enough.
The next allegation is, that the bribe may depend upon success. A sum of money may be promised to the electors if such a man is returned.
It is almost too obvious to need being remarked, that this expedient would be successful only with a small constituency. A candidate may be supposed to offer a sum which would be an object to each of two hundred or three hundred men, 10l. a man, perhaps; but who could offer what would be efficient among five thousand? Why 2l. per man would be 10,000l. And then, which is a sufficient answer to this allegation, how would an act of such publicity lie concealed, and go unpunished?
But, if it thus appears, as to me it does incontrovertibly, that there is nothing in the allegations which are brought to controvert the efficacy of the ballot in securing freedom of voting, we may consider the first question as decided, and may affirm that the ballot is calculated to produce all the good effects which its advocates expect from it.


Sq.—
Be it so, at least for the present; for I am not prepared to dispute your conclusions. But another inquiry remains,—namely, what are the ill effects which it produces?

Edition: current; Page: [218]

Sch.—
True; and the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ has very justly observed, that the ultimate decision for or against the ballot, as an institution, must turn upon the balance of its good and evil effects. The ballot implies a power on the part of the voter to protect himself by saying one thing and doing another, and the use of this power as often as necessary. In this, as far as I can perceive, is included the whole of the evil which the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ ascribes to the ballot; for he expressly rejects the arguments which have been vented by the petty advocates, telling us that speaking out is a good thing, not speaking out is a bad thing; that speaking out is English, not speaking out is un-English; and other childishness of the like sort.


Sq.—
It would have been unworthy of the writer not to see that such allegations prove nothing, that speaking out, and not speaking out, are good or evil, as the case may be. But the deterioration of the moral character produced by a habit of lying, is an evil of such magnitude, that I cannot easily form the idea of any consequent good which would be an equivalent for it.


Sch.—
The balance, as you and I have already agreed, should be accurately struck. But for this purpose is it not true, that the items on both sides of the account should be accurately examined?


Sq.—
To that there is no man but must assent.


Sch.—
What I complain of in the mode of proceeding of those who range themselves as enemies of the ballot is, that they have always evaded this examination. And this has struck me as a proof either of their rashness in taking upon them to settle an account which they have not examined; or the poverty of thought which they brought to the decision, if they were not aware that the examination was necessary.


Sq.—
But what do you mean by saying that they have evaded the examination? Does not the article in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ before us, present an appalling catalogue of the consequences of the mendacity produced by the ballot?


Sch.—
It does; but does an appalling catalogue come up to your idea of an examined catalogue? And if it does, what do you say to the other side of the account? The balance is ascertained by comparison of the two. It is very true that the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ began by an endeavour to show that the ballot would leave the voter as much liable as before to vote under compulsion. Had his argument to that effect been conclusive, the controversy was at an end. If the ballot could do no good, the smallest portion of evil on the other side would Edition: current; Page: [219] turn the balance against it. But we have seen that to this end his argument totally failed. At least, though I am not perfectly sure that you rely on the new conviction which you found you could not resist, you could find nothing in reason with which to oppose it.


Sq.—
That I must confess.


Sch.—
It is, therefore, incumbent upon you to take into account all the good which may appear to be the consequence of voting free from compulsion.


Sq.—
Suppose we do so; will not your complaint against the opposers of the ballot then be limited to this omission?


Sch.—
If it were, it would still be a very heavy complaint. What sort of judges can they be deemed who leave entirely out of their consideration the evidence on one side of the case?


Sq.—
When viewed in that light it does seem a serious charge.


Sch.—
And this is by no means the whole of the charge which I bring against them. They behave as ill with regard to their own as their adversaries’ side of the account.


Sq.—
How do you mean?


Sch.—
They give us rhetoric instead of computation.


Sq.—
You must speak plainer.


Sch.—
Observe what they do, and then say if it is not so.


Sq.—
I am attentive.


Sch.—
To form a just estimate of the immorality really belonging to the protective lie of the ballot, it is necessary to submit the act to a minute examination; to ascertain its properties with exactness, and determine what consequences these properties imply. Have the lie-abhorrers done this? Instead of it, they have given us a flashy picture, every feature distorted, nothing seen distinctly, and all covered over with a thick varnish of glaring colours. The object has been, not to do any thing for the understanding, but to make up a phantom hideous enough for the imagination. This might be all very well for a debating club, for a contest of rhetoricians, a game at oratory, or for a set of partisans who want not to enlighten but mislead. Legislators whose object is truth and the public good should proceed in a different manner.


Sq.—
Your complaint is too much in generals; I wish you to present the particulars of it.


Sch.—
I confess it is very inconsistent in me, complaining of others for their generals, to keep to them improperly myself. But I wished, not to be tedious; and therefore that my exposition should not be more minute than the necessity of the case seemed to require. Perhaps this further development will satisfy you.

Edition: current; Page: [220]

Sq.—
I am desirous to hear it.


Sch.—
I have already said enough, or nearly so, to determine what a man imbued truly with the spirit of legislation would do. He would examine deliberately that case of mendacity the possibility of which the ballot supposes, and he would fix its proper place in the scale of demerit; that done, he would consider and ascertain what are the ill consequences inseparable from such an act, and would fix their respective places in the same scale; the only mode of proceeding by which an accurate statement of the amount of actual evil could be given.


Sq.—
I now understand more distinctly the operations you would have performed.


Sch.—
Instead of this, what have our objectors done? Their business has been to select the most hideous images connected with mendacity in its worst forms, to put as many of them as possible into a great aggregate, presenting no distinct ideas to the understanding, but a horrible image to the imagination, the more horrible because obscure; like Milton’s devil, which shape had none, distinguishable in member, joint, or limb; and could be called neither substance nor shadow, for each seemed either.


Sq.—
I willingly allow that this is not a mode of proceeding by which legislators should lay the foundation of great measures. Whether you are right in laying the charge so heavily upon the oppugners of the ballot in the legislature, I have not the particulars of their conduct so fully in my recollection as to be able to say. But that is a question the determination of which does not press. The point of importance is to ascertain, by strict investigation, what the evil accruing from this source really amounts to. This, I fear, that my friends of the no-ballot cry have left undone. But that only renders me so much the more impatient to have this great service to the cause of truth and good government rendered by you.


Sch.—
Do not say rendered by me; for how can you expect from me what those great men have left in despair?—I say despair, because I cannot find any other apology so honourable to them. However, if you consent to join with me in the inquiry, we can enter upon it, and may at any rate proceed so far—possibly far enough to find the means of a certain degree of satisfaction to ourselves.


Sq.—
Agreed.


Sch.—
I presume we may go upon the assumption that there are lies—if, to please the men of the no-ballot cry, we must call every expression which corresponds not with the matter of fact by that opprobrious name—of all degrees of criminality, from Edition: current; Page: [221] the very highest to the lowest; some of no criminality at all; some absolutely meritorious.


Sq.—
I doubt whether I can go along with you to the full extent of this proposition. I see very well that there are degrees of criminality in lies; that a lie, for example, by a witness in a court of justice, intended to take away the reputation, life, or fortune of an innocent man, is a much more atrocious crime than to make your servant exclude your visitor by a lie at your door. But I am not willing to allow that there are any innocent lies; for I do not call any thing a lie which is not meant to deceive. And whatever is done by a lie had better surely be done without it.


Sch.—
If it can. But what if it cannot? Will you venture to say that there is nothing—there can be nothing—which had better be obtained than not, if it cannot be obtained unless a lie be told for it?


Sq.—
I cannot say that; because a number of cases immediately occur to me in which the attaining of certain ends by lying is accounted perfectly laudable; the stratagems of war, for example; the deceptions often usefully employed by medical men; those practised, when necessary, towards madmen; or even those by which violators of the laws are obstructed in the pursuit of their wicked designs.


Sch.—
You need not limit yourself to those instances. You can produce many more. Is it not reckoned perfectly honourable in a lawyer to do everything he can for his client; to use very gross acts of deception, not only by perverting facts, by making those appear to be no facts which really are, if by false glosses, and confusing the witnesses, it is in his power to do so, but making use, without scruple, of evidence which he himself knows to be false, making out, as proved, matters of fact, which never, he knows, had existence. Observe what the law itself and the judges do. The very instruments which they proceed upon and demand as the foundation of their acts, writs, bills, pleadings, are all full of notorious and ridiculous lies. They go further than that. They make no scruple to extort lies, aggravated by the violation of an oath. Though it is perfectly certain that twelve men cannot always agree upon a particular point, they compel every jury to declare, upon oath, that they have agreed. Though the value of a property stolen may be well known to be many pounds, they direct jurymen to declare, upon their oaths, that it is of another and far inferior value. And that without any blame imputed to either party.


Sq.—
That is so; but it is necessary to inquire into the meaning of all this. It is all done for the attainment of an important end.

Edition: current; Page: [222]

Sch.—
It professes to be so; and it is under the belief that it is so, that it passes without condemnation. But here we come to the difficulty which you said arrested your progress. Why is any thing we do done with a lie?


Sq.—
I see to what my own admissions have drawn me. I am no longer at liberty to say that a lie should not be told for the attainment of good.


Sch.—
Provided it cannot be attained without the lie; and provided it is a good which deserves to be purchased at such a price; for it is never to be forgotten that the rule of sincerity is of so much importance in human life, that a violation of it is always an undesirable means. And the levity with which it is set aside in modern manners is no slight imputation on the morality of our times. To such a degree is the observation of truth hold unnecessary, that a great part of the business of ordinary life is performed by the violation of it, not as a necessary, but a convenient, means. There cannot be a more striking example than the established expedient for declining to admit a visitor, by telling a lie at the door. How much of what is called good manners is grounded upon simulation, both by words and deportment indicating matters of fact which have no existence? The very terms of salutation and valediction, in particular the epistolary, are commonly gross violations of the truth. The common apology is, that they injure nobody; and on that ground it will readily be admitted that they deserve no very severe condemnation. Yet if they do no good, they are an evil, though small, still uncompensated.


Sq.—
But this doctrine of yours leads to a conclusion which I shudder to think of,—that truth, in itself, is not more estimable than falsehood, that each is valuable in proportion to the end it effects.


Sch.—
Do not say my doctrine; for I have done nothing more than lay before you the common practice and common sentiments of the world. I object to the terms of your conclusion, because they are equivocal.


Sq.—
How equivocal?


Sch.—
I think I can satisfy you by a few words. What is it that makes truth valuable to us?


Sq.—
The good it is the cause of.


Sch.—
What is it that procures approbation of certain deviations from it?


Sq.—
The good they are the cause of.


Sch.—
It is thus admitted by you that, in themselves, and without regard to their effects, speaking truly and falsely are equally matters of indifference. In this sense, therefore, the conclusion you draw from the received morality is true; but Edition: current; Page: [223] there is another sense in which it is very far from being true. Take speaking truly and speaking falsely in conjunction with their effects, and the difference is unspeakable. The good effects of speaking truly are constant and universal; the good effects of false speaking are occasional only, and, in comparative amount, a trifle. The general rule, therefore, is, that truth is to be observed. But for the very reason for which it is to be observed,—namely, the good which it produces, it is to be abstained from when it would produce not good, but evil. Depend upon it, Sir, whenever you find a man affecting a zeal for truth beyond this mark, it is not morality which is the spring within him.


Sq.—
The moral grounds which you have laid down do, indeed, seem to be incontrovertible.


Sch.—
And it was of importance to lay them correctly, because all the plausibility bestowed upon the ‘no-mendacity’ part of the argument against the ballot is derived from keeping the true moral grounds of the question out of view; and in place thereof, thrusting a quantity of false morality in our faces. The question appears to me to be now brought within a very narrow compass. We have only to inquire whether the good to be obtained by the deviation from the line of truth which the ballot may occasion, can be obtained by any other means; and whether the good is so small that the deviation is too great a price to pay for it. Is this inquiry worth entering upon, or is it not?


Sq.—
What is worth entering upon, if this be not? I do entreat you to proceed. I never was more deeply interested in anything.


Far.—
I am so deeply interested, that my tongue has been tied. I have not had a faculty but attention alive. It is of infinite importance to men in such circumstances as mine, to feel that, in protecting themselves against their oppressor, they do nothing of which they need to be ashamed. This will keep the pride of virtue alive in their breasts.


Sch.—
The first inquiry, then, we have to undertake is, whether the end to be obtained by the lie of the ballot, can be obtained without it.


Sq.—
Can it, or can it not?


Sch.—
There is one very obvious way—namely, that the possessors of the compulsory power should cease asking promises before, or confessions after, the vote. If they could be either prevailed upon, or compelled to abstain from this exercise of their power, the object would be gained, free voting would take place, and not a lie would be told.

Edition: current; Page: [224]

Sq.—
That is clear.


Sch.—
It is also clear, that if they act the other way, they, and they only, are the cause of all the lying which takes place. The guilt of it, therefore, belongs to them.


Sq.—
The great guilt undoubtedly belongs to them. Whether there is not a separate guilt of him who allows the lie to be extorted from him, we have yet to see. But this abstinence of the landlords, which would save the lying, is it a thing to be expected of them, or not?


Sch.—
The writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ goes openly and stoutly on the ground, that they can neither be counselled nor compelled; that they have objects of their own to gain by exerting the power which their fortunes give them; that they are men governed by selfish and ungenerous purposes; and that all the blessings of good government opened to the hopes of their countrymen have no charm for their eyes, nor anything but the profits of misrule, which, by defeating the ballot, they hope still to secure. The author in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ is not sparing in his condemnation of this conduct. But he affirms it will take place.


Sq.—
Is he, or is he not, right in that opinion?


Sch.—
First, as to persuasion, I must confess I see no equivalent which can be held out to them for the profits of misrule, which they might secure by defeating the ballot; and such an equivalent, I am afraid, is the only medium of persuasion, from which any great effect could be expected.


Far.—
You must allow me to come out with an observation here, though it is hardly in point to this part of your inquiry. But I have been wondering within myself, since you began to speak of the certainty with which the no-ballot men conclude that the landlords would exert their power to secure to themselves nomination if the ballot were obtained, what they could possibly mean by calling upon us to believe that these very men would not think of securing to themselves nomination, if voting were open; as if the same thing which would be to them an object of uncontrollable desire, if voting were secret, would be to them no object of desire at all, if voting were open; and, thereupon, exhorting, or rather commanding us, not to desire the ballot till we should see whether the conduct of the landlords would render it necessary or not. They could not foresee what the landlords would do with their power when they had not the ballot to obstruct them. They foresee perfectly what they will do with it, if the ballot stands in their way. This is a mystery in their conduct, which I wish you would explain.


Sch.—
It is not necessary to conclude them altogether dishonest Edition: current; Page: [225] in the maintenance of these contradictions; nor altogether foolish. Self-interest is a great confuser of ideas, especially in the minds of those whose habits of thinking have been formed under all the perverting influences which arise from the possession of power. Evidence is no evidence with such men, when it goes against their desires. No proposition is fit for proof, but that which they wish to be true. But though I have no equivalent for those who might hope still to secure nomination by extorting promises from persons voting secretly, I may conclude thus far with certainty—that they will not continue to extort promises, after experience has proved to them that it is of no use. Now, if the vote can be rendered perfectly secret, as I think I have proved that it can—and if, as I think I have also proved, the means either of intimidation or bribery, with the ballot, and a constituency sufficiently large, are too insignificant to be of any avail, it is not doubtful that the promises exacted by landlords will be utterly useless; that asking them will, therefore, be soon relinquished, and become utterly discreditable. The evil of lying, therefore, will be short-lived; the benefits of free voting will have no end.


Sq.—
If I do not misrecollect, the writer in the ‘Edinburgh Review’ has anticipated this remark of yours, and refuted it.


Sch.—
I thank you for reminding me of that passage in the article. We should have it before us.


Sq.—
I can turn to it immediately.


Sch.—
Do so, and read it.


Sq.—
It is this:—

‘If the ballot had been coeval with our elective system, the case, we readily admit, would have been different. Our feelings and our habits would have been fitted to it, and have grown up in harmony with it—always supposing that it had continued to be a really secret method of voting. To ask a vote, still more to ask a question as to how a vote had been given, would no more have entered into any man’s mind, than it now does to overlook a person when he is writing, or to open letters directed to another. But we are considering what protection the ballot, now first introduced, will give to men whose habits are already formed, and cannot be changed—at least during the few years that they would bear such an experiment to be tried.’

—Edin. Rev. No. CXII. p. 555.




Sch.—
I claim this as an affirmation of my opinion. It says that, after a time, secrecy would extinguish the very thought of asking a promise or confession.


Sq.—
The Reviewer only says, that if the ballot had been coeval with our elective system, it would had these effects.


Sch.—
Surely you do not suspect the Reviewer of putting forth so untenable a proposition as this—that the effect of Edition: current; Page: [226] secrecy, as part of the elective system, would be good, if it began with the system, but bad if it begin at any other time. What is there in the commencement of an elective system, which should give an effect to secrecy different from the effect it would have at any other point of its duration? No sooner is the proposition distinctly announced, than its futility is seen. The motive to influence votes are of the same kind at the beginning as at any subsequent point of an elective system. If a man has an object to gain by forcing a vote, will he be less disposed to serve himself at the commencement, than during the currency of a voting system?


Sq.—
That would certainly be too much to expect; but is there not weight in what the Reviewer says about the habits we have now acquired, and should have to overcome?


Sch.—
Let us not talk of those habits vaguely and obscurely. What are the habits we have now, and should not have at the commencement of an elective system? I know but of one—that of commanding the open voter to vote as we please. As to the demanding a promise from the secret voter, that can be no habit when secret voting begins. What is the habit here which is to be overcome? The habit of commanding open votes is gone, when open voting has ceased.


Sq.—
Let us not keep to a construction of the mere words of the Reviewer; let us make a liberal interpretation of his sense. I think he must be understood to mean that the habit of commanding open votes would be followed by a propensity to command secret ones.


Sch.—
If we do, I think his argument will not be a strong one. Pray, how did the habit of commanding open votes begin?


Sq.—
You mean me to say, I suppose—and, in truth, I see not what else I can say—that it began, because he who had the power to command, had also the will.


Sch.—
That is to say, he obeyed the dictates of his interest. But why look out for any new habit, to account for a man’s obeying those dictates? Is not that the master-habit? But what if voting had been secret from the beginning? Would not the same interest which made men seek a command over open voting, make them seek it also over secret?


Sq.—
Undoubtedly it would.


Sch.—
And is there anything in the mere point of commencement that should make the feeling of interest less cogent than afterwards?


Sq.—
I do not see that there is.


Sch.—
Then the desire of the man, who had the same interest Edition: current; Page: [227] to serve, in commanding secret votes, would not be less strong to command them at the commencement of a voting system, than at any subsequent stage of it.


Sq.—
I know not why it should be so.


Sch.—
But, at the commencement, the Reviewer says, that desire would have died away; and, again, he says it would not die away at the subsequent stage. But why would it have died away at the first stage? Solely because ineffectual. It will be equally ineffectual at the subsequent stage. Will not the same effect proceed from the same cause? No, says the Reviewer. Why? Because men have acquired the habit of commanding open votes. What reasoning! Because men have continued to do a thing by which they promoted their interests, they will be sure to go on doing another thing, by which they do not promote their interests.


Sq.—
I do not, indeed, see how the one of these propositions follows from the other.


Sch.—
And if it does not, we are at liberty to conclude, that the landlords of the present day, when they find promises of no use to them, will cease exacting them as well now, as they would a thousand years ago.


Sq.—
I think it is vain to contend against that conclusion.


Sch.—
The last sentence of the paragraph you have read is, to me, somewhat obscure. The writer desires us to observe, that he is ‘considering what protection the ballot, now first introduced, will give to men whose habits are already formed, and cannot be changed—at least during the few years that they would bear such an experiment to be tried.’ What is it that you understand by these words?


Sq.—
I understand what I think is the obvious meaning of them; that the habits men now have, are adverse to the efficacy of secret voting, and would make them abolish the practice sooner than change their habits.


Sch.—
Your comment is not much clearer than your text. We must look at the words a little more closely. The men whose habits the Reviewer here speaks of are evidently the voters—the men needing protection against the vote-compellers. But it is altogether out of my power to conceive what habit they can have adverse to the efficacy of secret voting. What we desire is, that they may vote as they please. Is the Reviewer so ill read in human nature, as to imagine there can be a habit, which men cannot get over, of acting contrary to their will? Men may act contrary to what they desire, under a dread of evil. But will the Reviewer tell us that the landlords Edition: current; Page: [228] of the present day have more power over the occupants of their land, than the landlords ‘coeval with our elective system?’


Sq.—
What, then, is it you conclude?


Sch.—
That the Reviewer, by these words, has not strengthened his argument. He here supposes a habit adverse to the efficiency of secret voting, in the voters, when there is no such habit; and he allows that the secret voters, if voting had always been secret, would have defeated their masters at the beginning, but would be defeated by them now; that is, when their dependence upon their masters is incomparably less, and their intelligence much greater.


Sq.—
The words, when thus examined, do appear to have been inconsiderately spoken.


Sch.—
We may as well, since we are upon this passage, not omit the conluding clause of it—where the writer intimates that the voters would not tolerate secret voting more than a few years. What motive should the voters have to seek the abolition of secret voting?


Sq.—
He doubtless alludes to the oppression which he had above supposed the voters would be liable to, under the suspicion of having voted contrary to orders.


Sch.—
Which oppression we have already shown to be impracticable, and not an object of dread. These reasons are wholly without force; and, therefore, leave the conclusion clear and unembarrassed—that the ballot will accomplish its object, and enable the voter, however dependent in his circumstances, to vote as he pleases, without any terror of consequences.


Sq.—
I am not able to oppose these conclusions, and must consider them with such care as will either enable me to refute them, or show me the necessity of assenting to them. But I seem to have lost the thread of our discourse, and must endeavour to resume it. We had remarked that the Reviewer made two assertions—one, that the landlords could not be persuaded; another, that they could not be prohibited, from endeavouring to command secret votes. You had allowed that they could not be persuaded; but proceeded to show that the endeavour would be ineffectual; and that, being without a motive, it would, therefore, cease: and you have shown, with, at least, much appearance of reason, that the arguments of the Reviewer against that conclusion, are without force. It remains, however, for you to show, that it is not impossible to prohibit the selfish endeavours of the landlord.


Sch.—
If I have established the conclusions at which we have now arrived, I think the argument is at an end. Where would Edition: current; Page: [229] be the utility of prohibiting men from a practice, which you know they will not use? And what better security against a practice, than the knowledge, that nobody will have any motive to it? Upon these grounds the utility of the ballot is already demonstrated. However, I think it best to go through all the pleas, and shall, therefore, invite you to suppose that the arguments we have just produced, to show that the compeller of votes will be frustrated, and that he will not long endeavour, when he finds he must always endeavour in vain, are yet unknown to us; that he has, in short, a power of evil, which, not being able to persuade him to relinquish, we desire to take from him. The question is, have we the means? The Reviewer says not. It is our business to inquire. Is not that your meaning?.


Sq.—
It is.


Sch.—
When a man, or set of men, have a power which they make a bad use of, there are two modes of dealing with them—either to restrain them from the bad use, or to take away the power. The Reviewer has considered only the first mode of remedy, and has passed over the last, as if it did not exist. This is a great error in reasoning. What he has endeavoured is, to prove that no penalties, which could be applied by the legislature to the use made of their power by the owners of large estates in coercing secret voters by punishing those whom they might suspect of voting contrary to their wishes, would be effectual.
If this were true, it would only be an argument for the abolition of large estates. The greatest enemy in the land to the existence of large estates is this Reviewer. There is a power in the hands of those landlords which is used to evil purposes. This use must be prevented. It cannot be prevented, says the Reviewer, by restraining the power; but it can, we say, by taking away the power; and this, if the Reviewer is right, is the only remedy. Quod erat demonstrandum. A formula which in this place, I think, we may apply without a joke. Do you concur with me?


Sq.—
Your conclusions come upon me so rapidly, that, though I have seen no flaw in the reasoning, I fear to admit them. If the Reviewer is right in affirming, that the owners of large estates can by no means be hindered from making a bad use of their power, I cannot refuse your conclusion, that it is an argument against the existence of large estates; but I recoil from the idea of a law to break up large estates.


Sch.—
Not surely, if good government is placed on the one side, and large estates on the other. You do not, I imagine, Edition: current; Page: [230] prefer for your country large estates to good government. Society was not made for large estates, but for the community. If large estates can be reconciled with the good of the community, leave them to themselves; if they cannot, the consequence is inevitable: they ought to be abolished; nor is there any use in lamenting the catastrophe, which will assuredly come, whether we like it or not. This is the ultimate and sure remedy, if there is no other to be found.


Sq.—
You think the ballot will prevent the bad exercise of the power of large estates, and therefore you have no hostility to them; but as I wish every hypothesis to be sifted, let us wave for a moment your argument on this subject, and suppose that the ballot will need aid against the machinations of the landlords, do you think that the Reviewer, when he says that the evil use of the power cannot be prevented, is right?


Sch.—
I think he is far from right; I think that many expedients might be employed, without going the length of dividing large estates, which would reduce the mischievous exercise of the power they confer within very narrow limits.
The expedient of direct penalty—the only one which seems to have been in the contemplation of the Reviewer—would, perhaps, be feeble, as he says, from the difficulty of bringing evidence; but, nevertheless, a penalty, and a very heavy one, ought to be applied, which might be paid, in whole or in part, for his evidence, to the voter whose promise or confession had been demanded; and by which compensation might be made to those who suffer injury by an honest vote. It is not an argument against such a law, that there would be difficulties in the execution of it. The main thing wanting would be appropriate tribunals; and their only difficulty would be in determining the value of the evidence received. Suppose a man swears that his landlord had endeavoured to suborn his vote, it would often be difficult to determine whether the landlord should be fined upon such evidence. If a man, however, so swears, and can show by probable circumstances that he has suffered injury from his landlord through suspicion of his vote, there would be no difficulty at all; and in this way the penalty would operate strongly as a safeguard to the voter.
It might be rendered open to any candidate to call upon any landlord to make oath that he had neither intimidated nor bribed. I think that public feeling would operate strongly in sanction of the purity of such an oath. It would not be a custom-house oath, or a clergyman’s oath; about which the public are indifferent. An oath on this subject, known to be foul, would leave a stain behind it. Even a penalty, therefore Edition: current; Page: [231] would not be so useless as the Reviewer endeavours to prove; and he entirely overlooks the more efficient checks.


Sq.—
I am impatient to hear what would be more efficient checks.


Sch.—
The means of coercion which a landlord possesses may be mostly summed up, I think, under three heads:—1. The power of dispossessing; 2. The power of pressing for arrears of rent; 3. The power of withholding indulgences. In regard to the first two, I think you will not deny that the power of oppression in the hands of the landlord may be reduced.


Sq.—
Perhaps not, when you have shown how it is to be done; at present I do not see.


Sch.—
To begin with the power of dispossessing, that is limited by every lease. Why not make leases adequate to the protection of the voter?


Sq.—
I see that a lease is protection against dispossession during its currency; but what happens when it expires?


Sch.—
Would pure voting, and all the blessings of good government consequent upon it, be in your opinion too dearly purchased, if there were no other means, by declaring all leases perpetual?


Sq.—
Certainly not; but it would be a great infringement of property.


Sch.—
It is not even liable to that objection; it would be a measure in strict conformity with the principle on which all property rests: that no man shall use that which he calls his own in a way to injure other people. If leases cannot be subject to renewal without such injury, leases must be made perpetual.


Sq.—
I know not how to combat your conclusions; but they do not please me.


Sch.—
I shall please you better, perhaps, by saying that I do not think perpetuity of leases necessary to prevent the injury which might be made to attend the renewal of them; though I should approve the perpetuity, if I thought the injury could not otherwise be prevented.


Sq.—
How then is the injury to be prevented, if the leases are to be renewed?


Sch.—
If the terms of the renewal are left to the landlord, the injury will take place. The terms, therefore, must not be left to the landlord, but committed, along with the entire question of renewal, to an appropriate tribunal, by which an equitable arrangement could easily be made.


Sq.—
I think, indeed, this might be done, without any great infringement of the principle of property; because an equitable tribunal would weigh the landlord’s reasonable objection to any Edition: current; Page: [232] man as a tenant, and would estimate correctly the rent which he ought to receive.


Sch.—
I think, then, we are agreed, that this part of the landlord’s power to do mischief might easily be taken away. We may, therefore, proceed to the next.


Sq.—
That, I remember, is the pressing for arrears.


Sch.—
It is well known that landlords have provided for themselves a power over this class of debtors such as is granted to creditors of no other class: I mean, distraint—a power which stands on no ground of reason, and ought to be abolished. This would greatly lessen their power over a tenant suspected for his political opinions, as they could only enforce a debt through the operation of law. But still the power would be too great, and must be further abridged. The same tribunal which determines whether a lease shall be renewed, and on what terms, should have the power of determining what time a tenant in arrear should have for making payment.


Sq.—
These are great restrictions on the power of using a man’s property.


Sch.—
That is not the question; but whether they are greater than is necessary to prevent him from using that property in a manner injurious to others? for that is the law under which all property is held. Besides, I do not give these as the best expedients: they are such as have suggested themselves to me at the moment; others, which are preferable, are perhaps to be found.


Sq.—
You have then shown how two of the landlord’s modes of coercing a tenant may be taken away. How do you dispose of the third—that of withholding indulgences?


Sch.—
Farther than by the restrictions we have already considered, on the renewal of leases, and raising of rents, and pressing for payment of arrears, I do not see that it would be necessary to interfere. If besides secure possession, at a reasonable rent, with moderation in pressing for arrears, a landlord is beneficent in other respects to his tenants, his conduct will have its effect upon their minds—will naturally incline them to oblige him. This, however, is not coercion; this is an influence which I have no wish to diminish.


Sq.—
There is, however, one contingency still which would afford coercive power: I mean the occasional necessity for remissions of rent.


Sch.—
These necessities, I think, arise from bad laws; and I have not mentioned them, because, when the corn-laws are abolished, those fluctuations of price, which the necessities in question arise from, will be prevented. When they do exist, Edition: current; Page: [233] the question of remission is obviously a question for the tribunals we have been speaking of; and thus, you see, that, even waving, as you wished, the conclusion we had come to, that the landlords would not persevere in asking promises or misusing their power over those tenants whose votes they suspected, the means of taking away the power of abuse are not difficult; and that, according to either supposition, the objections to the ballot are overthrown.


Far.—
You have now determined so many points, in a way, I must say, very pleasing to me, that my poor head is a little bewildered. I want to have them all at once before me, that I may survey them together, and see to what they amount.


Sq.—
I will endeavour to perform this service, both for you and for myself; feeling not less than you the necessity of combining the propositions we have established, and comparing them with the questions which the controversy involves.
First, then, we considered the objections made to the efficacy of the ballot;—that it could not produce secrecy;—that it could not prevent the obtaining of votes by intimidation;—that it could not prevent the obtaining of votes by certain kinds of bribery. These objections were all shown to be futile: that the ballot could produce secrecy; that it could prevent the obtaining of votes by intimidation; and prevent the obtaining them by bribery. From this we proceeded to the next branch of objection, the evils ascribed to the ballot. We found that they might be considered as all summed up in the word lie; and entering upon the moral question, we soon perceived, not only that lies were of all degrees of criminality, from the highest to the lowest, but that there were lies even moral and obligatory; that the occasions, however, of good obtained by deviations from truth were so few, compared with those obtained by adherence to it, that the deviation was an undesirable means, and should only be admitted when the good could not otherwise be obtained. Can the good we look to from the ballot be obtained without it? was then the question. Yes, if landlords can either be persuaded, or compelled, to abstain from the impure exercise of their power. The ‘Edinburgh Review’ says they cannot. We then entered upon an inquiry, which has led us to an affirmative conclusion upon both branches of the inquiry: we found that landlords would soon be persuaded, if not by other people, at least by their own experience, that asking promises was a useless and discreditable labour:—we next found, that their powers of intimidation might be so effectually taken away, that a dependent would risk but little in refusing to tell in what manner he intended to vote, and that the landlord Edition: current; Page: [234] might be made to risk a great deal by attempting to force him. It appears to me, therefore, that we have arrived at this most acceptable conclusion—that we may, by the natural course of things, have all the benefit of the ballot without the evil of the lie; and at all events, may secure that result by a very obvious and simple piece of legislation.


Far.—
This being so, the inquiry is undoubtedly at an end; for what more can we desire to have, than proof that the ballot may be made really to produce the good effects which its friends expect from it, and without any of the ill effects which are imputed to it by its opposers?


Sq.—
I do not see that anything more is necessary, if our conclusions are really sound. But however strong the chain of reasoning by which we have arrived at them, and by which I have found my assent to them compelled, I still feel that my reliance on them is imperfect.


Sch.—
We have already adverted to the state of mind you are in—not an unnatural one, nor of rare occurrence; your old belief is contending with your new convictions; what you want, is to be familiarized with your own convictions. A conviction becomes a practical principle only by being made familiar; and many people continue through life acting contrary to their convictions, because they have never been at home with them, and have therefore continued under the influence of some contrary notion, because an old acquaintance. This is one of the shapes in which mental weakness displays itself; stronger minds easily incorporate the new conviction, and master the bias of merely habitual belief.


Sq.—
A fair warning to me.


Sch.—
You need not take it so, unless you please. I would rather consider you as an example of those who master, than of those who are mastered by, the mere habit of a belief.


Sq.—
But have we really then brought the inquiry to a close?


Sch.—
Logically speaking, or, for the satisfaction of reason, I think we have; but, rhetorically speaking, or, for the purpose of popular persuasion, something perhaps is still wanting. The rhetorician in the ‘Edinburgh Review’—a master in that commanding art—has handled, with much appearance of persuasion, a topic which we have not yet considered. Going upon his own hypothesis, he runs out in a display of consequences of a very odious character, and then concludes that the ballot, even if it produced all the good we contend for, would still be the cause of a balance of evil. It is true we have refuted his hypothesis, and his consequences, therefore, are consequences of nothing. Still I think we ought to consider them; because Edition: current; Page: [235] there are many people to whose old habits of thinking they will prove very consonant. Even upon his own hypothesis we can show that his consequences do not hold.


Sq.—
That will be an important addition to our argument.


Sch.—
The Reviewer affirms, that landlords will continue to extort promises, and will receive lies; that this habit of lying will taint the character of the voters; and that this is not all; for the voters, to protect themselves from the vengeance of their landlords, must continue to speak sentiments in accordance with the promise they have made and broken; that is, to profess sentiments different from those which they hold—to pass, in short, a life of lying. A very formidable train of evils, doubtless; but a state of things the possible existence of which, even to the mind of a theorist—and here the Reviewer is a rank theorist—ought to have appeared doubtful. There have been seen states of things in which a handful of men in a nation have been compelled for ages to profess sentiments which they abhorred;—the poor Jews, for example, in Spain and Portugal,—to whom, however, on that account, nobody ever imputed moral depravity; but a state of things, in which a mere handful of men in a nation compelled a great and influential portion of the whole to continue professing sentiments which they abhorred, never yet was seen in the world, and we may safely pronounce never will.
First of all, what are we to think of a Reviewer, even of the rhetorical class, who, discussing a question, which he informs us turns upon a comparison of evils, leaves his argument lop-sided; that is, gives us an overcharged catalogue of evils on the one side, but wholly omits those on the other?


Sq.—
What is it you mean? For I do not willingly admit this charge.


Sch.—
Observe, that I mark it only as a charge of inadvertence, not of design. But it is a proof how easily the fairest minds are betrayed into controversial injustice, and how much it imports us all to be on our guard against it. For do you not think, that he ought to have given us a catalogue, as fairly made out, of the evils from which the ballot would deliver us, as of those which it would bring along with it? And has he done any such thing?


Sq.—
I must say that he has not; and I see the necessity we are under of doing it for him.


Sch.—
I cannot help remarking upon one part of the conduct of the men who signalize themselves by their zeal against the ballot—and that is, the wonderful horror they have of a lie, Edition: current; Page: [236] when it accompanies the ballot; and the want, at least, of all sign of any horror of the lie which attends open voting.
The comparison of these two lies is, in this question, a matter of cardinal importance. If they were lies of the same degree in the scale of moral depravity, the evil, as far as they go, would be equal on both sides. If there is the greatest possible difference between them in this respect, the balance of evil rests with the more criminal of the lies.


Sq.—
Explain to us what you mean by the lie on the side of open voting?


Sch.—
It appears to me surprising, that it should need explanation to you, or to any body; and yet I imagine the fact is very generally overlooked. Such is the effect of evil custom, and so little is ill looked for in a practice which has long been unconsidered. You will allow that, in undertaking a trust, there is an engagement to discharge it honestly—a promise, in short, solemn and binding in proportion to the importance of the trust.


Sq.—
Undoubtedly, I allow that.


Sch.—
What do you think of the trust of choosing a member of parliament? Is it not important exactly in proportion to the importance of having a good parliament?


Sq.—
Yes, I must certainly allow that; because a parliament can be good, only as the members of it are good.


Sch.—
And I suppose you will allow that the goodness of a member depends upon two things—his having intelligence to see what is good for his country; and his having no prevailing motive to betray it.


Sq.—
Certainly.


Sch.—
I know you have reflected enough upon this most important of all subjects, to have determined in your own mind the reason why an oligarchy, or combination of a small number of the richest men of a community, is necessarily a bad government; and a government genuinely representative is necessarily a good government.


Sq.—
I think I understand the reason of that. An oligarchy is necessarily a bad government, because its members have the means, and hence the temptation, to benefit themselves at the expense of the community. A representative government is a good government, because its members have not the means of benefiting themselves at the expense of the community, and are therefore left to the influence of the motive which all men have, to seek the good of the community of which they are a part.

Edition: current; Page: [237]

Sch.—
We shall also agree, I imagine, that an oligarchy does not change its nature, by a mere change of its outward forms. I mean, that whether the members of it act directly in their own persons, or by means of instruments, so long as the acts of the government are dictated by their wills, and by their interests, the case is nearly the same; bad government is necessitated.


Sq.—
That I am far from denying, and as far from denying what I see you are coming to—that a House of Commons, chosen by the members of an oligarchy, is merely an oligarchy acting by its instruments, and as certainly producing bad government as if they acted in their own persons.


Sch.—
Now, then, we have got pretty close to the matters of fact which we are interested in understanding. When a voter, voting openly, yields to the intimidation of his landlord, he lends his vote to the production of the oligarchical power, while his covenant with his country is, to use it exclusively for the purpose of good government. This is not a simple lie. It is a lie with the strongest circumstances of aggravation. It is a breach, not of an ordinary promise, but of a promise on which good and evil, to an incalculable extent, depend. Have you anything similar to say of the lie which may be forced upon the secret voter?


Sq.—
The evil of the lie which is committed by the secret voter, is the evil of a deviation from truth—which, however, not only taints the character, but produces more or less of a tendency to disregard truth.


Sch.—
The Reviewer produces two cases of evil, springing from the mendacity of the ballot; and that is the first of them. The second is, the course of mendacity, which terror of his landlord makes the voter continue, to cover the breach of his promise. The first of these is what we have first to consider. As you have now put his position—which, as far as I remember, you have done correctly—this evil consists of three particulars: the deviation from truth; the taint of the character; and the greater readiness to lie. Now the two last of these, I imagine, are one and the same thing. By tainting the character, I suppose is meant, making the character worse, that is, making it more disposed to the commission of crime. Taint, in any other moral sense, I do not understand.


Sq.—
I do not suppose the Reviewer meant it in any other sense; and I agree with you, that the last two items in the enumeration must be considered the same.


Sch.—
The whole charge, then, consists of the simple evil of lying, and the tendency which one lie may have to produce other lies.

Edition: current; Page: [238]

Sq.—
Agreed.


Sch.—
But it has been found, that there is a lie on each side of the account—a lie with the open vote; and a lie with the secret vote. As far, then, as the two items of the reviewer go, the simple evil of lying, and the tendency of a lie to produce more lies, the cases are equal; and there is no reason, on this score, to dislike secret, any more than open voting. The prodigious preference given to open voting, therefore, must come from something else than reason.


Sq.—
As far as this point is concerned, I grant it you.


Sch.—
Such are the two lies in themselves. We have next to compare them in their circumstances. For we have already seen, that in point of morality, the difference between one lie and another is prodigious; and that the circumstances make all the difference. Thus, the lie by which a wicked son takes away the life of his father is not, in itself, a greater deviation from truth, than the lie by which a general deceives an enemy, and saves his country.


Sq.—
I not only agree to this, but am satisfied, from what you have said, that it is an important article in the science of morals, too often obscured by vague and sentimental terms.


Sch.—
I think, then, after what has already been explained, we may proceed, in a summary way, to our conclusion. The open voter, who votes under intimidation, having promised to his country to vote for the man he thinks best, and having broken his promise by voting for the man he thinks worst, is the cause, along with others, of establishing an oligarchy, and perpetuating all the consequences of misrule—that is, a combination of all the worst evils, both physical and moral, incident to human beings, upon all the millions who constitute the body of the community. This is not exaggeration. Though these evils may not anywhere be seen in full aggregation, and though there may be counteracting causes, in some places of more, in some places of less, efficacy, that does not alter the natural tendency of the horrid cause, nor imply any abatement of its effects, further than as other causes obstruct its operations. In the case of the open voting, therefore, we have the lie, in conjunction with all the unspeakable evils of misgovernment. In the case of the secret voting, we have the lie, in conjunction with all the unspeakable blessings of good government. I will not ask you which of these two lies is most to be deprecated. But I will ask you, and ask all the world, whence comes it we have so many personages expressing the utmost horror at the lie attended with the good consequences, but without a word to say against the lie attended with the evil consequences?

Edition: current; Page: [239]

Sq.—
The contrast, as thus presented, is most striking. I know not how far habit, to which we have so often had recourse for a solution of moral difficulties, will account for this strange phenomenon.


Sch.—
I think it accounts for it in a great degree. But the phenomenon thus accounted for is a most remarkable exhibition of the mode in which the moral sentiments of the ruling class—I mean their habits of moral judging—become depraved under the operation of a system of government habitually pursuing the good of the few at the expense of the many.


Sq.—
But still you allow, that the lie is so much of a drawback from the good of the ballot.


Sch.—
I do not think that this much concerns our argument. In most deliberations for public good, we have to content ourselves with a compromise. Seldom any arrangement produces pure advantage. That is the best, which produces equal good with the least evil. But we must look a little more narrowly at the lie which produces the good, and see what the common reason of mankind has taught them to think it. By the supposition, the good is not to be obtained without it. For, if it be, the lie should be condemned. The lie of the ballot, then, does for us two things—it saves us from all the evils of bad government; and it bestows upon us all the blessings of good government. You will tell us—for you are well acquainted with this branch of science—what the moralists of all ages have determined, as to the character of a lie of this description.


Sq.—
I must own, without reserve, that they have all determined it to be a moral act.


Sch.—
But you will allow, that a moral act cannot taint the character—cannot create a propensity to immoral acts.


Sq.—
To say so, would, I think, be a contradiction.


Sch.—
The Reviewer’s imputations, therefore, on the lie of the ballot are groundless. He said, it was in itself a bad act; and that it produced a bad tendency. We have seen that it is, in itself, not a bad act, and that it cannot produce a bad tendency. We might, therefore, proceed to his second list of evils—those subsequent lies with which he says the lie of the ballot must be followed up. But, as the point is of great importance, I wish to hear the grounds upon which moralists go, in determining, that when a deviation from truth is found to be the only means of warding off an evil, or obtaining a good, it loses its culpable character, and becomes a moral act.


Sq.—
I need not go to any remote source for the illustration of this point, when I find an approved one at my hand. In Dr. Paley’s chapter on ‘Promises,’ he has a section entitled, Edition: current; Page: [240] ‘In what cases promises are not binding.’ Among other cases, he says:—

‘Promises are not binding, where the performance is unlawful; as where an assassin promises his employer to despatch his rival or his enemy: a servant to betray his master: a pimp to procure a mistress: or a friend to give his assistance in a scheme of seduction. The parties in these cases are not obliged to perform what the promise requires, because they were under a prior obligation to the contrary. From which prior obligation, what is there to discharge them? Their promise—their own act and deed. But an obligation from which a man can discharge himself by his own act is no obligation at all. The guilt, therefore, of such promises lies in the making, not in the breaking them; and if, in the interval betwixt the promise and the performance, a man so far recovers his reflection, as to repent of his engagements, he ought to break through them.’

He adduces another case, and says, ‘Promises are not binding where they contradict a former promise.’ He adds, ‘because the performance is then unlawful; which resolves the case into the last.’ In the chapter on ‘Service,’ he says:—

‘A servant is not bound to obey the unlawful commands of his master—to minister, for instance, to his unlawful pleasures, or to assist him by unlawful practices in his profession: as, in smuggling, or by adulterating the article in which he deals. For the servant is bound by nothing but his own promise; and the obligation of a promise extends not to things unlawful.’

Paley has a chapter on ‘Lies,’ Here he lays it down, that ‘there are falsehoods which are not lies; that is, which are not criminal.’ He then gives an enumeration of the kinds of falsehoods which are not lies, nor criminal; and in particular mentions these:—‘Where the person to whom you speak has no right to know the truth; as, when you tell a falsehood to a madman, for his own advantage; to a robber, to conceal your property; to an assassin, to defeat or divert him from his purpose.’


Sch.—
This is enough, and a few words will suffice to show the application of the doctrine of Paley to the case of the ballot. First of all, Paley says, that ‘promises are not binding where the performance is unlawful.’ Surely nothing can be more unlawful than promises to rich men to combine in bringing all the evils of misrule upon the community to which men belong. If there be wickedness in promises, this is wickedness which cannot be surpassed. Paley says next, that ‘promises are not binding where they contradict a former promise.’ The voter’s original promise to his country was, that he would vote for him whom he thought the fittest man. A subsequent promise to vote for him whom he does not think the fittest man contradicts the former as flatly as it is possible for one promise to Edition: current; Page: [241] contradict another. Paley says, further, that ‘a falsehood is not a lie, that is, not criminal, where the person to whom you speak has no right to know the truth.’ And what right has the man of wealth to know how the poor man, his dependent, votes; when the law has given the poor man the privilege of secret voting, on purpose that his rich master should not know, and who, therefore, cannot take measures for knowing, without a violation of the law; a violation which ought to be punished? The illustrations of Paley import that a falsehood is not a lie, whenever it is told to defeat a person, who has intentions leading to evil, in carrying them into effect. As no intentions can lead to greater evil than those of the man who would establish oligarchy, no falsehood can be more remote from the imputation of criminality than that which defeats him in such a design.


Sq.—
Paley says, the guilt of such promises lies in the making, not in the breaking them, but he does not exempt them from guilt.


Sch.—
A promise, however, given under terror, can produce no habit of promising without terror. In the breach of the promise there is morality, not immorality; and in the promise there is no tendency to a habit. What becomes then of the vehement fears of the reviewer, about the evil habits which the falsehood of the ballot must engender? It is thus proved to be exempt from all such tendency?


Sq.—
Still, would it not be better that the secret voter should refuse to promise?


Sch.—
Yes; and I can mention to you what would be better even than refusing the promise; that it should not be asked. If there be guilt in making the promise, there must be tenfold guilt in extorting it. The promise is given by a trembling dependent, to save himself and family from some of the worst of evils. It is extorted by the master to procure to himself certain advantages, which are to be secured by bringing evils without number upon the great body of the community to which he belongs. The giving the promise is so far innocent, that it injures nobody; and it is given under a motive which few men can be expected to have the power to resist. The extorting tends to incredible evil; and arises purely from that sort of motive, which the law, under penalty of death, requires all men to resist, the desire of getting what does not belong to them. What, if we cannot hope that the extorting will not go on? What also, if we cannot hope but that men in dependence will not act like men out of dependence? What is the consequence? Only this; that we must deal with things as they are, not as Edition: current; Page: [242] if they were what we wish them. If we cannot get good voting without a promise which is broken without injury to any body, and without the smallest tendency to produce bad habits, we must be contented to get good voting upon these terms, and be glad that they are no worse.


Sq.—
I think you have so fully exposed the attempt to discredit the ballot, on account of the broken promise, that we may now proceed to the remaining allegation of the reviewer,—that the breach of promise must be followed by a life of lying.


Sch.—
There is one thing, before we proceed to that topic, which I think it may be well to notice. It may be said by others, though it has not been said by the reviewer, that a lie not only creates a tendency to tell more lies, but an entire relaxation of principle, and a greater readiness to yield to every temptation to crime; as we consider that the moral character of a woman who has lost her honour is not partially but entirely gone.


Sq.—
Well, what have you to reply to this objection?


Sch.—
First, that it proceeds upon a very shallow view of human nature. What is it that makes a breach of chastity in the one sex be thought so complete a subversion of the moral character; and to have not even a tendency that way in the other? Whenever the objector has solved this question, he has made out an answer to himself.


Sq.—
I am anxious to know how it is solved by you.


Sch.—
The solution is too obvious to be missed by any body. In the one sex the breach is regarded as one thing, in the other as another thing. When a man commits a breach of chastity, he knows it will not be thought by the world, nor is it thought by himself, that he has done anything seriously wrong. The woman both herself thinks, and believes that others will think, that she has committed a great crime. This it is which degrades, which impairs the moral character—the inward thought of having violated an obligation. There can be no doubt, that in every instance in which a man violates a known obligation, he weakens his habit of obedience to obligations. But this has no operation in the case of the ballot; for, in voting as he thinks best, notwithstanding his promise, he knows that he is not violating, but fulfilling his most sacred obligation. On the other hand, the moral contamination we have spoken of would assuredly adhere to the keeping of the promise; when he would act under a sense of violating his most sacred obligations, and would thence be the better prepared for every species of crime. And now for the reviewer’s life of lies.

Sq.—
Ay, do satisfy me on that point; and then I shall hardly have a scruple remaining.


Sch.—
The objection supposes a general opposition of sentiments between landlords and tenants. A few instances would be unimportant. It supposes that the landlords would generally receive promises from their tenants to vote for anti-reform candidates, and would vote for reformers; that the landlord would watch them afterwards, and take vengeance on those who should utter the sentiments of a reformer, as being those who had voted in opposition to his wishes.


Sq.—
Yes, this is the real import of the objection.


Sch.—
My answer to this is twofold: 1. That the landlords could not exercise the oppression—of the will to which the reviewer supposes them to be in full possession. 2. That the power of such oppression, if they had it, must necessarily be taken away from them; and that it might easily be so.


Sq.—
If you make good these two positions, assuredly you will remove the objection.


Sch.—
First, I am to show that the supposition of the oppression is absurd. We have inquired what are the landlord’s means of oppression; and we have found that they are two: the power of turning tenants out of their farms; and that of pressing them for arrears of rent. But we may defy the most ingenious orator to produce a proposition which will excel in absurdity that in which it is asserted, that the landlords of a country will choose to beggar themselves, to go without income; for that must be the consequence of turning off their tenants.


Sq.—
Do you not here exaggerate? The argument does not suppose all their tenants, but some only.


Sch.—
As many as are necessary to the end?


Sq.—
Yes, certainly.


Sch.—
That is all. For where would be the use of turning off a few and leaving the rest; when the void must be filled up by men of the same stamp; and when the next time they will all vote as they did before?


Sq.—
The supposition is that they will not; because the example made of a certain number will strike terror into the rest.


Sch.—
This is not the least absurd part of this tissue of suppositions. Suppose a certain number of men were taken up at a venture, one in every thousand, for example, of those that pass at Charing-Cross, and were hanged for the prevention of thieving; would not such a practice be truly operative in the prevention of theft?


Sq.—
This would have no effect in preventing theft; because Edition: current; Page: [244] the thief would see that his chance of the punishment would not be increased by his thieving; but that he was just as likely to be hanged if he kept from stealing, as if he did not. It is not, however, in your style, to resort to such a medium of refutation. This is not argument. It does not even come up to rhetoric.


Sch.—
What is the fault of it? Your objection, I suspect, arises not from its not being argument; but from its being an argument which strikes harder than you were prepared for. What can be more in point to prove an absurdity, than to produce a parallel case, the absurdity of which all the world must acknowledge?


Sq.—
What I object to the case is, that it is not parallel.


Sch.—
And I affirm that it is exactly parallel. The men are taken up at Charing-Cross without its being known whether they are thieves or not thieves. The tenants are turned out without its being known whether they have broken their promises or not; for that the secrecy of the ballot renders impossible to be known. The man who is to vote knows he runs the same chance of being punished if he keeps his promise, as if he breaks it. The two cases, therefore, I affirm again, are exactly parallel. And the dread of such punishment affords no motive whatever to regard the promise.


Sq.—
You must allow this difference at least; that of the men taken up at Charing-Cross nothing is known. Of the tenants, this at least is known, that they speak such and such sentiments.


Sch.—
True. But do you observe what this comes to? To this; that the men are punished for holding such and such sentiments. This is a new hypothesis; but which I am willing to examine, if you have leisure to hear me.


Sq.—
I am well inclined to hear you.


Sch.—
I say that this supposition is, if possible, still more absurd than the former. For I beg you to say, whether you can conceive anything more contrary to credibility, than that the great body of a people should be held in such terror, by a small number of the men of the same community, as to be made to profess opinions all their lives which they hold in abhorrence. The supposition implies a passiveness and servility, such as the most degraded state of our nature has never exemplified. In the present state of Europe, the attempt could not be made without the ruin of the attempters. This would be to set up a war, not between property and the want of it, but between a few great properties on the one hand, and an overwhelming superiority of property, in moderate portions, in many hands, Edition: current; Page: [245] and all the rest of the community along with it, on the other; a war, the event of which would not be one week in deciding. Surely the circumstances involved in this supposition the reviewer cannot have considered for one moment.


Sq.—
It does seem a little wild, I must confess; and will not serve as an engine to batter down the common-sense advantages of the ballot.


Sch.—
To show the impossibility of it still farther, let us consider once more what are the means possessed by the men of large property of effecting so strange a coercion. We have seen that they are but two—the power of dismissing tenants, and the power of pressing them for arrears of rent. We have also seen, what is too evident not to be immediately recognized, that to realize the supposition of the Reviewer, landlords must ruin themselves. Now we may be satisfied, that if landlords cannot defeat the ballot but by ruining themselves, it is pretty safe.


Sq.—
I do not question that; but show me a little more distinctly how they are to ruin themselves.


Sch.—
You allow that their income depends upon their tenants; and according to the supposition of the Reviewer, they will deprive themselves of tenants.


Sq.—
I do not remember where the Reviewer says so.


Sch.—
That shows you have not read what he says attentively. He says they must turn out all those of their tenants who do not invariably speak oligarchical sentiments. Three-fourths, at the least, must be supposed to hold sentiments directly the reverse; and the Reviewer tells us, that men of that class cannot go on for any length of time successfully counterfeiting sentiments they do not hold. Three-fourths of them, therefore, will fall under the rule of condemnation: that implies, that three-fourths of all the land of the country are thrown out of cultivation, and that the great landlords of the country deprive themselves of three-fourths of their income. They render themselves, therefore, men of small incomes, and ruin their influence by endeavouring to make it exorbitant.


Sq.—
But the supposition of the Reviewer is, that the landlords will not need to turn out all their anti-oligarchical tenants; that a few of them turned out, for the sake of example, will make all the rest vote as they are required to vote.


Sch.—
And we have already proved the absurdity of that supposition, by showing its similarity to the plan of preventing theft, by hanging every thousandth man at a venture. That a man should be hindered from voting as he pleases, by fear of an evil, which it is twenty to one he will never feel, and of which Edition: current; Page: [246] he does not lessen his chance one atom by voting according to his conscience and his wishes, is a supposition at the very summit of extravagance. To press for arrears of rent, as means of coercion, would fail for the same reasons—as might be shown by similar explanations. But as they are abundantly obvious, and I would not be tedious, wo may omit them, unless you think otherwise.


Sq.—
I agree with you.


Sch.—
It is only necessary then to add—and this also we have already proved—that if the landlord’s power of turning his tenants out, and harassing them for arrears, were not incapable of destroying the securities for good government, which we expect in the ballot, but as potent to destroy them, as the argument of the Reviewer supposes, we have another remedy. It is the easiest thing in the world to take away those powers—either by forbidding the existence of large properties, or by taking away the arbitrary power of landlords over tenants, by giving the question of the renewal and terms of leases, as well as of the exaction of arrears, to the decision of an equitable tribunal.


Sq.—
These last conclusions of yours I do not find myself more able to resist than those which preceded them; and I believe, according to your doctrine of the necessity of being familiarized with the conclusions which have satisfied one’s reason in order to convert them into practical principles, that I want nothing more, to be a practical friend of the ballot, than to have incorporated the reasons for it with the rest of my habitual associations.


Sch.—
Having shown, as I think, effectually, that the arguments of the Reviewer, by which he undertakes to prove that the ballot is impotent for good, but potent for evil, are untenable, it seems to me that we have cause for the highest exultation.


Sq.—
What is it you mean? Not mere triumph over a controversial opponent?


Sch.—
Something very different; I mean the assurance of exemption to the human race from the train of evils which would have been their inevitable lot had the arguments of the Reviewer been found to be just. Admit his conclusions; and it follows, that good government is an impossibility; mankind are born to be the spoil and prey of a small number of their wretched fellow-creatures, whom their position renders of necessity the most worthless of their species.


Sq.—
The train of consequences you thus adumbrate I see too faintly to be able to trace them; I therefore wish you would point them out somewhat more distinctly.

Edition: current; Page: [247]

Sch.—
I shall only have to repeat what I have already said, that, according to the Reviewer, a small number of rich men command a majority of the votes of poor men, and that for this there is no remedy; that the promise held out by the ballot is illusive, besides which it is accompanied with peculiar and overbalancing evils. This, I say, is an argument against the representative system, and if the argument were good, a conclusive one; for it would prove that the representative system leads necessarily to oligarchical power, the very worst of all the bad shapes of power, and enables it to act with more security under the mask of representation. Most assuredly, if a majority of the persons sent to serve in parliament must be sent by a few rich men to do as they are bidden, that is, to rule the country for their masters, it would be much better that the masters should rule it directly, without the farce of representation, and all the lying and hypocrisy which attends it. The extent of misrule is not abridged by that scheme of deceit, it is enlarged. The remarkable thing is, that the Reviewer goes on establishing this doctrine with an air of gaiety, and of something even more exulting than self-satisfaction. Yet the prospect, we should think, is such as to strike a damp into any heart which is not made of stone. Admirably was the nature of oligarchical morality understood by Plato, when he made the oligarchical advocate lay it down seriously that moral good is that which is good for the strong man, moral evil that which is not good for him. Habit so conciliates us to this doctrine, that even a man like the Reviewer, who has not an oligarchical wish in his mind, is not startled when he arrives by a train of reasoning at this monstrous conclusion.


Sq.—
If it be true that his argument would prove the impossibility of good government,—and I confess I see not how it can be obtained, if not through the representative system, which his argument sets aside,—I must pronounce his apathy wonderful.


Sch.—
As we contemplate the case now, setting the real circumstances before us, it would seem impossible that any thing, having the senses and feelings of a human being, should not be melted at the thought of all the miseries with which misgovernment overwhelms the mass of mankind, all fixed on them irremovably from generation to generation to the end of time. But it is not so wonderful that men who contemplate the case in another point of view; who are familiar with the delights of those on whose account these miseries are produced; whose thoughts have been accustomed to run in the same channels, to think with approbation of what brings delight to them, with disapprobation Edition: current; Page: [248] of that which brings uneasiness; while the pains and pleasures of all the rest of mankind, still more the great causes of their pains and pleasures, are too little thought of to weigh in their minds as objects of much comparative regard, should have their sensibilities little affected by the general idea of misgovernment; and should not feel greatly shocked when brought, by a train of their own reasoning, to the terrific conclusion that such is the inevitable lot of mankind.


Far.—
This apology may do for them so far as it accounts for what I have often observed; a disposition to protect and uphold the poor, in men who were zealots for institutions that would crush them. But surely men enslaved by habits of such partial and insufficient observing and thinking, men whose conclusions may be founded, without their knowing it, upon ideas which embrace but a fraction of the subject on which they presume to decide, are little to be trusted as rulers of nations,—far unfit to judge, in the last resort, of what is good and evil for mankind. And now I think we have provided an answer to all the objections of the no-ballot men. At least I, for my part, cannot think of another.


Sch.—
There is, however, yet another which goes upon a very different ground from that which the Reviewer has taken in the greater part of this article; not upon the ground of the ballot’s not being efficient, but on that of its being too efficient. And it is curious enough that there are even two sets of arguers upon this single ground: one set complaining that the ballot will destroy the influence of property; the other that it will destroy the influence of poverty.


Far.—
That is an admirable ground which supports contradictory conclusions.


Sch.—
I hope you have observed that something like this characterizes most of the allegations against the ballot: one set of them is pretty regularly a negation of another; and yet its adversaries seldom scruple to urge them both. The Reviewer, however, does not associate himself with those who complain that the ballot would destroy the influence of property. He would be ashamed to advocate that only influence of property which the ballot would destroy. He declares that he reprobates that influence. But he says the ballot would do great mischief by precluding the influence of poverty. This, at any rate, has an air of generosity, this is the tone of a protector.


Far.—
But how is it that the ballot can prevent the influence of poverty? Or what influence is poverty possessed of?


Sch.—
I had no doubt this allegation would surprise you. And no wonder. The theory, however, of the allegation is this. Edition: current; Page: [249] The greater portion of the people are not allowed the privilege of voting. If those who possess the privilege (people of some property) vote in secret, that other portion of the people (those of no property) have no influence on their voting. And this is an evil of which they have a right to complain.


Far.—
I doubt whether I understand this doctrine; because it looks to me like an argument not against the ballot, but for universal suffrage.


Sch.—
Do you not think the Farmer sees into this subject with clearer eyes than some of his betters?


Sq.—
His observation makes me ruminate. I will not venture to say it is wrong.


Sch.—
If you consider it a moment longer, you will find it is right. We may go to the bottom of the subject at once; which for the most part, I think, is better than scratching the surface.


Far.—
Only take me along with you.


Sch.—
The sole ground and justification, in reason, of taking a part, and not the whole, of the population for the basis of a representative system is, that a part may be taken, much less than the whole, but yet sufficiently extensive to be thoroughly identified in interest with the whole. The inference is, that the general interest is thus secured. The security of the general interest is that which is sought for by good government; and in that is included the interest of the non-voting, as well as that of the voting part of the community. The share of the non-voting part in the general interest, that is, in the blessings of good government, is, by the supposition, perfectly ensured to them without their exerting any influence on the voting. By the supposition, therefore, they cannot possibly exert any influence counter to the natural tendency, but for evil; and if the ballot protects the voting part from such influence, it is a necessary instrument of good.


Far.—
The arguments of those who are against the ballot do turn out, upon your shewing, to be very poor things; they are just nothing at all.


Sch.—
A mistaken argument naturally appears so, whenever it is opened up, and seen with its disguise taken off. Your suspicion that the argument against the ballot—ascribing benefit to the influence of the non-voting over the voting part of the population—was an argument in favour of universal suffrage, you see, is perfectly just. If that influence could be of any use, it must be because the voters would not make the best choice without it. But if the non-voters can induce others to make a fitter choice, it must be because they are fitter to choose themselves. This conclusion, I think, is inevitable.

Edition: current; Page: [250]

Sq.—
I cannot dissent from it, and therefore I do think that this argument, if it does any thing, goes to prove the superior fitness of universal suffrage.


Sch.—
The argument, it is evident, goes upon the assumption, that the constituency is defective, and that it needs external influence to keep it right. But a constituency can be defective in only two ways, either by not wishing to make the best choice, or by not knowing the best. It cannot have a will not to make the best choice, but by having a sinister interest, that is, an interest opposed to the general interest. It cannot mistake the best choice, but for want of intellect. The argument, therefore, implies, either that a constituency short of the entire population cannot have the will to make a good choice of representatives, or that the entire population is fitter, in point of intellect, to make a good choice than any section of it; at least than that section which we at present take in this country.


Far.—
Certainly nothing can be more clearly proved than the inconsistency of those who maintain the goodness of our present constituency, and yet say that it needs to be kept right by the influence of those who make no part of it.


Sch.—
The extreme inconsiderateness with which the arguments against the ballot show that they have been brought forward, is not one of the least remarkable things attending them. To tell us in one and the same breath that we have two sets of men in this country, one set who are the fit and proper men to make the choice of representatives, the other altogether unfit; but that the unfit men ought to have the power of influencing, that is, altering, the choice of the fit men, is a monster in the way of deduction, at which one stares with astonishment.


Sq.—
You should have added, of altering by intimidation; for that is the necessary supposition; and that an argument should land in such an absurdity, and the arguer not perceive it, does certainly imply a want of consideration which is nearly incredible.


Note, by the Editor of the Dialogue.
This talk about the responsibility of the elector has been recently renewed, and with such bragging assurance, that the futility of it may require to be a little more minutely set forth. The ‘Times’ newspaper of 21st January, 1835, publishes a speech of Lord John Russell; and in its leading article remarks that Lord John had settled the question of the ballot by ‘one Edition: current; Page: [251] neat observation,’ or words nearly the same with these; and the ‘neat observation’ lauded by the ‘Times’ is, that the ballot relieves the voter from responsibility.
The heads which lend themselves easily to the delusion of names are not the small class. Responsibility here does the business of Lord John. He has got the name, and the thing, he imagines, goes along with the name, as the substance with the shadow.
Lord John would be puzzled if he were called upon to tell what he means when he talks of the responsibility of the people. The electors are the people, if your representative system is not a mockery. They are a portion of the people such, that in their political interests the interests of all the rest are included; that, when their interests are pursued, the interests of all the rest are pursued; when their interests are sacrificed, the interests of the rest are sacrificed. The electors, therefore, and the rest of the people, are the same in point of interest, or your pretended representative system is radically vicious, and calls for a radical reform.
What responsibility does Lord John think applicable to a man in the management of his own affairs? When Lord John appoints a housekeeper and a butler to look after his interests in the kitchen and cellar, does he need any other responsibility than his own responsibility to himself, that is, his own sense of his own interest? can there be any other security so good for his making the best choice he is capable of making?
What does he imagine is done by the people in choosing their representatives? Do they not make choice of agents to look after their interests in the business of legislation, just as Lord John chooses agents to look after his interests in the business of the kitchen? and can they need, or can there be, any other responsibility for their choice, than what Lord John is under in choosing his servants, the knowledge that a good choice will be good for them, a bad choice will be bad for them?
Lord John must not think it impertinent, after the way he has talked, if we ask him a plain question,—if he knows what is meant by responsibility? Lord John knows many people, and admires some, who are very ready in the use of the word, but know the meaning of it no more than what name it goes by in the language of Brobdignag.
What is it we do to a man when we make him responsible for any act of his? Do we not contrive some means or other of making it contrary to his interest not to perform it as we desire he should? that is, in other words, of making it his interest to do it? Responsibility means always this one thing, an interest Edition: current; Page: [252] created to a man by external agency to do something which we wish done and which he would not have a sufficient motive to do without the operation of that agency. When he has that motive, responsibility is a word without a meaning. Where would be the use of saying a man is responsible for eating when he is hungry, for resting when he is tired? When it is made a man’s interest to do so and so, whether by the hand of nature, or the hand of art, the object is gained. But where nature does the business without art, the latter is useless and absurd.
Lord John, however, and the ‘Times’ newspaper, scorn this mode of reasoning. They say that art ought to be added to nature in securing the good choice of representatives. And how is it they think the art is to operate?
By the supposition, nature has secured, by making it the interest of the voter, the best choice he is capable of making. But, say the two heads of Lord John and the ‘Times,’ we must have something more, we must have publicity, which makes the voter responsible. But this responsibility must either operate in the same direction with the voter’s own previous interest, and then it is not wanted; or it must act in opposition to it, and then it is pernicious.
Having thus seen, that the responsibility of the voter, which Lord John and the ‘Times’ newspaper are so anxious to provide for us, would, on the most favourable supposition, be altogether useless, let us entreat them to consider (for it appears they have not yet done so) the price they would have us pay for this mock security, this insignificant instrument, this gewgaw of theirs.
To obtain it we expose the voters to the force of all the influence which wealth possesses on poverty, that is to say, we place the votes of the great majority of the voters at the disposal of the rich, who thus become the absolute masters of the country, and constitute an oligarchical government with all its abominations.
The publicity certain persons are so eager for, produces, therefore, two responsibilities. It makes the voters responsible, they say, to the non-voters, and it makes them responsible, as we say, and they must confess, to the class of men whose riches give them a power of good or evil to a great extent over their poorer neighbours.
Who sees not that the responsibility of the poor man to the poor class of men is as nothing; his responsibility to the class of rich men is commanding? For the name, then, of responsibility, without a grain of the reality, operating in the right direction, these patriotic enemies of the ballot desire us to Edition: current; Page: [253] constitute a responsibility, operating in the wrong direction, with a force which is irresistible. Such is the bargain they recommend to us, and that with a zeal which, considering the nature of the bargain, is enough to startle us.
The zeal with which they recommend such a bargain is the more remarkable, that they themselves declare and proclaim the utter worthlessness of that responsibility for which they would have us to pay so fatal a price. Is it not they who affirm with assurance, that if voting were secret, the farmers would keep away from polling at the bidding of their landlords, that this coercion would be complete? And what does that declare with the voice of a trumpet? What but this, that the motive created by the power of good or evil in the hands of the poor multitude is as nothing; the motive created by the same power in the hands of the rich few is irresistible. Can there be a stronger argument for the ballot than this? can there be a more pointed satire on the pretence that the knowledge by the people whether a man did or did not vote according to his conscience would be a security to us for honest voting? The farmer who stays away makes proclamation of the fact. He says to all those around him, the opinion you may hold of my conduct is of small importance to me compared with what I have to hope and fear at the hands of my landlord. My responsibility to you is something in name; my responsibility to him is something in terrible reality.
The tendency of all the arguments against the ballot being to bestow unlimited power on the small class of rich men in the state, or to persuade us that their hold of it cannot by any means be prevented, gives rise to serious reflections. Is it that the enemies of the ballot see not these obvious consequences? or, that seeing them, they have no aversion to them? Some of them are not like the ‘Quarterly Review’ men, and the other enemies of the Reform Bill. The consequences of that Bill they speak of with an abhorrence which amounts to frenzy, the furious language of madmen. It shows what interest they had in the consequences of the unreformed state of things. Wherever there are abuses, there are men to profit by them; and whenever profit is taken away by the reform of such abuses, there will be men to curse the reform, the men who have produced it, and all those whose train of thinking awakens the dread of more such reforms.

POSTSCRIPT.
Since our Article on the political state of the country was sent to press, the experiment which, when that Article was written, was but in an early stage of its progress, has been completed. By the result of that experiment, it is ascertained, first, that even with all the defects still inherent in our representative system, the crown and the aristocracy can no longer force upon the nation a ministry against its will; and, secondly, that the nation will not endure a conservative ministry. The time, indeed, is not come for a ministry of thorough Reformers; and the Tories, as little as the Whigs, now profess themselves thorough anti-reformers. Tories may grant reforms; and Whigs, as the people well know, will often refuse them, or pare them down into insignificance. But there is this difference between the two parties: the Whigs at least profess to love reform; the spirit of examination and change which is abroad is no subject of lamentation to them; they declare themselves gratified by it, and take credit to themselves for having helped to produce it. The Tories, on the contrary, look upon that spirit with avowed suspicion, most of them with absolute terror; they make no pretence of sympathizing with it; and whatever concessions they are willing to make to it are made avowedly to necessity.
By such persons the nation has now declared, in a manner not to be misunderstood, and which has carried conviction to the minds even of those to whom such a fact is least palatable, that it will not be governed. It will not have for ministers men who confess that their hearts are not in the cause of reform—who lay claim to support, not for what they will, but for what they will not, do, to forward the amendment of our institutions. Men who would govern this country from henceforward must not be men who thought our institutions perfect five years ago, and who declare that their opinions have not changed. They must either have the sincere belief, or the decent pretence of a belief, that those institutions were and are imperfect—that there are changes, which are not merely necessary evils which the people unthinkingly demand, but a good in themselves.
This is a lesson, not without its value to those who still needed it. In all other respects, the prospects of the nation appear to us, after this change, exactly as they appeared three months ago. The progress of reform appears to us certain; and we know Edition: current; Page: [255] full well that it will be slow. Any ministry which can be formed out of the scanty and inefficient materials afforded by the present houses of parliament will leave much to be desired—much to be criticised—much to be pardoned. We do not call upon the thorough Reformers to declare enmity against them, or to seek their downfall, because their measures will be half-measures, often not more than quarter-measures; nor even because they will join with the Tories in crying down all complete reforms, and will fight the battle of half-reform with anti-reform artillery. This the thorough Reformers are prepared for, and we believe they will disregard it. But we do implore them not to implicate themselves in the responsibility of a half-reform policy. They may support a ministry, where it deserves support, with far greater effect out of office; and they will retain the inestimable advantage of being at liberty to advocate what, as members of a cabinet, they would not have it in their power to carry into effect. Let them not allow themselves to be circumvented by the time-serving doctrine, that it is imprudent to propose anything which has no chance of immediate success. All great things which have ever been accomplished in the world, since Opinion became the ruler of it, have been accomplished by attempting things which for years, or generations, or ages after the first attempt, had not the remotest chance of success. Whoever, as a statesman, acts upon any other maxim, aims not at the glory of himself exercising any influence over the fortunes of his country or of mankind, and aspires only to register decrees, in the framing of which he voluntarily declares himself unworthy to have any voice.
If the ambition of the thorough Reformers be not limited to this paltry object, they will penetrate themselves with the conviction, that it is for others to consider what can be carried through the House of Commons; but that they are there to stand up for what is good in itself, let who will be minister, and however small a portion of the House may go along with them.
From the ministry we neither expect nor demand all this; nor has the time yet come when so manly a course would be consistent with their remaining a ministry. But there is one thing which is not too much to require of them. We cannot expect that they will propose measures which are in advance of the House of Commons; but, unless they would be utterly contemptible, let them not, this time, confine themselves to such as they trust will be agreeable to the House of Lords. That this was the principle, the systematic principle, of Earl Grey’s ministry, we have the public testimony of Lord John Edition: current; Page: [256] Russell, in a speech to his constituents in Devonshire; and Lord Melbourne’s answer to the Derby address was in the same spirit. If the new ministers act upon a similar principle; if, as often as they believe that the House of Lords would throw out a measure of improvement, they mutilate it, or refuse absolutely to introduce it, and perhaps even assail it when introduced by others; if they again place themselves as a barrier between the Lords and public odium, and, to shield the real culprits, take upon themselves the responsibility of withholding from the nation its just demands,—their administration will assuredly not last one twelvemonth. Recent events are proof more than sufficient, if proof had been wanting, that it is impossible to please the Tories and the people both. The people will not have the Tories, even on a promise to act like Whigs; and ridiculous indeed would the expectation be, that they would tolerate Whigs who should again make it their avowed principle to act like Tories.

Art. I.: THE CHURCH, AND ITS REFORM.
IN the article on the State of the Nation, in the first number of this publication, it was said—‘We should now go on, and point out the reforms, which we think are needed, in the other great provinces of abuse, Law and Religion; but we have been led on so far, illustrating the spirit of reform, that we have not space for these particular subjects, and must allot to them separate articles, in the future numbers of our publication.’
This promise, in what regards the institution appropriated to religion, we shall now endeavour to fulfil. ‘Bacon says, “If St. John were to write an Epistle to the Church of England, as he did to that of Asia, it would surely contain the clause, I have a few things against thee!” I am not quite of his opinion. I am afraid the clause would be, I have not a few things against thee.’ These are the words of Dr. Jortin—(See his Tracts, vol. i. p. 350.)
‘In England we certainly want a reform, both in the civil and ecclesiastical part of our constitution. Men’s minds, however, I think are not yet generally prepared for admitting its necessity. A reformer of Luther’s temper and talents would, in five years, persuade the people to compel the Parliament to abolish tithes, to extinguish pluralities, to enforce residence, to confine episcopacy to the overseeing of dioceses, to expunge the Athanasian Creed from our Liturgy, to free Dissenters from Test Acts, and the ministers of the establishment from subscription to human articles of faith. These and other matters, respecting the church, ought to be done,’ &c.
Thus Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, delivered his sentiments, in a letter to the Duke of Grafton, in the year 1791.*
One of the most remarkable of the sentiments here expressed is the belief of the power, which a single advocate of reform, of the proper stamp, might exert on the public mind in England, and through the public mind on the House of Commons, and through the House of Commons on all that is faulty in our Edition: current; Page: [258] public institutions. ‘A reformer of Luther’s temper and talents would, in five years’ (in 1791, be it observed, when the minds of men were ill-prepared) ‘persuade the people to compel the Parliament,’ &c. The great characteristics of Luther were courage, activity, and perseverance; for in intellectual endowments he was equalled by many of his contemporaries; and by some, Melancthon and Erasmus, for example, surpassed. We mention this, and request attention to it, as a matter of encouragement to those whose minds are elevated and blessed with the love of reform. It requires, they may see, but the will in any individual of a class, which now is numerous, to be the author of blessings, analogous to those achieved by him who, among mortals, was the greatest benefactor of the human race.
Among the reforms which five years of proper exertion might bring about, in the ecclesiastical part of our institutions, the Bishop enumerates the abolition of tithes, the extinction of pluralities, the compulsion of residence, the confinement of episcopacy (meaning, literally, overlooking or superintending) to the appropriate function which the name denotes; besides these, erasing the Athanasian Creed from the Liturgy, abolishing the Test Acts, and subscription to Articles of Faith.
Forty-four years have passed over our heads, and, of all this, how much has been done? We have abolished the Test Acts! And yet the people are accused of being too impatient for reform; as indicating, by their impatience, a desire to destroy religion—aye, and government along with it.—And so they would be if they were only to complain of a single bad thing once in a hundred years.
The Bishop is far from intending here a systematic view of the bad things in our ecclesiastical machinery. He mentions a parcel of particulars, by way of exemplification, and ends by saying, ‘these, and other matters,’ &c. We know that he laid great stress on one thing which is here not mentioned at all; reducing the emoluments of the overpaid priests of all descriptions, and giving something more to the class whom the clergy think sufficiently paid with a beggarly pittance.
The time is come, when a service of unspeakable importance would be rendered to the community, by a full and detailed exposition of the good which might be done by a well-ordered and well-conducted clergy; of the want of good in any shape derivable from our present ecclesiastical corporation, while it is the perennial source of evil to an incredible amount. It is obvious, that such a work as we contemplate is not compatible with the space which could be allotted to it in this publication, or the Edition: current; Page: [259] time which could be bestowed on one of its articles. But we shall enter into some details, to give a clearer view of what we recommend to others, and earnestly desire to see accomplished.
We shall begin with some illustrations of the proposition, that the present ecclesiastical establishment in England is a perfect nullity in respect to good, but an active and powerful agent in the production of evil.
It is one of the most remarkable of all the instances which can be adduced of the power of delusion, when well supported by artifice and power—that, up to this hour, an institute, truly characterized by the terms we have just applied to it, should be still looked upon as a fabric, venerable for the benefits which it confers upon the people, at whose charge it is upheld.
It has not the look, the colour, not even one of the outward marks, of an institution intended for good.
The world, at least the Protestant world, needs no information respecting the abuses of the Romish church. That ecclesiastical establishment had been reared up into a system, most artfully contrived for rendering men the degraded instruments and tools of priests; for preventing the growth of all intellect, and all morality; for occupying the human mind with superstition; and attaching the very idea of duty to nothing but the repetition of ceremonies, for the glorification of priests.
At the time of the great revolt from the domination of the Romish priesthood, while other countries broke down and struck off, some more, some less, but all a great part of the machinery, by which the Romish church had become the curse of human nature, the English clergy embraced that machinery very nearly as it stood, have clung to it ever since with the most eager attachment, praised it to the skies, and done whatever they could in the way of persecution against all who condemned it.
Look at the facts, and see how distinctly they support this representation.
Did not our church-makers retain the same order of priests? archbishops, bishops, deans, prebendaries, rectors, vicars, curates; with the same monstrous inequality of pay?
Did they not retain the very same course of clerical service—nay, the very same book of formularies, doing little more than translate the Mass-book into the English Liturgy?
Renouncing allegiance to a foreign head was the principal part of the change which took place in England, and the abolition of the religious houses, to satisfy the rapacity of the king and the nobles. But the employment and duties of the clergy remained as before, with some little alteration. The Church of England parson has less to do than the Romish priest; and Edition: current; Page: [260] being allowed to involve himself in the cares of a family, has a mind less devoted to the concerns of his place.
If the Romish establishment was not framed for the production of good, but was an exquisitely-fashioned instrument for the production of evil, is it not certain that the English establishment, which consists of the same integrant parts, must very closely resemble it in its tendencies?
Let us look at this subject a little more closely. Can any thing be a greater outrage upon the sense of propriety; a more profligate example of the contempt of public good; than to see a concatenation of priests, paid, in proportions, ranging from the height of princely revenues, down to less than the pay of a common footman; without even a pretence that the duties of the most miserably rewarded portion are less onerous or less important than those of the set who are paid with so immoral and disgraceful a prodigality?
The next thing which solicits the attention of all rational men, is the work which the English clergy are called upon to perform for this pay; exhibiting, in their extreme, the opposite vices of extravagance, and deficiency.
We undertake to maintain the two following propositions: First, that the only services which are obligatory upon the Church of England clergy, and regularly performed, are ceremonies, from which no advantage can be derived. Secondly, that the services they might render, in raising the moral and intellectual character of the people, are not obligatory, but left wholly to their option, to do, or not to do; that they are performed always most imperfectly, and in general not at all. Let us go to the particulars.
The services obligatory on the Church of England clergymen are, the Sunday service, performing the ceremony of baptism, that of marriage, and that of the burial of the dead.
To estimate the value of them, let us see wherein they consist.
The Sunday service. That consists almost wholly in the repetition of certain formularies; read out of a book called the Book of Common Prayer. On this part of the duty (the work is actually called duty) of the Church of England priest, the following observations are inevitable.
1. The repetition of forms of words has a tendency to become a merely mechanical operation, in which the mind has little concern. To whatever extent the repetition of religious formularies becomes mechanical, it is converted into an unmeaning ceremony.
2. The formularies themselves are of the nature of mere Edition: current; Page: [261] ceremonies. They consist of creeds; of short sentences called collects, which are commonly words of Scripture thrown into the form of ejaculations, or petitions to God; prayers, especially the Lord’s Prayer; and extracts from the Bible. It is needless to mention the Communion Service, because, excepting the purely mechanical part, handing what is to be eaten and drank, it consists of the same things.
It is necessary to bestow a short examination on each of those particulars.
Of the repetition of creeds, the best thing which can be said is, that it is purely ceremonial. If it is not ceremonial, it is far worse: it is a forced declaration of belief—in other words, an instrument for generating the worst habit which can be implanted in the human breast—the habit of saying the thing which is not—the habit of affirming as a matter of fact, that which is not a matter of fact—the habit of affirming that a man is conscious of a state of mind, when he is not conscious of it.* This is to poison morality in the very fountain of life. The fine feeling of moral obligation is gone in a mind wherein the habit of insincerity is engendered: nay, more—every man who is possessed of that fatal habit possesses an instrument for the perpetration of every other crime. Mendacity is the pander to the breach of every obligation.
The collects, which are short sentences—mostly words of scripture, thrown into the form of ejaculation or petition—we may take along with the prayers; and of the whole lot together we may affirm, that if it is not ceremonial, and without meaning, it is a great deal worse.
The most important, by far, of all the religious sentiments is—the distinct, and steady, and perpetually operative conception of what is implied in the words, Almighty Being of perfect wisdom and goodness. Without this, there is no religion. Superstition there may be, in perfection. Priestism is its nature; it is a contrivance of priests, and always manufactured for their ends. When deluded people are made to think ill of the Divine Being, they are in the hands of the priests, and can be made to do whatever the cunning of the order prescribes to them.
Edition: current; Page: [262]
The tendency of the Church of England prayers is to give a wrong notion of the Divine attributes; and instead of the idea of a Being of perfect wisdom and goodness, to present the idea of a being very imperfect in both. To speak of them in the most general way, we may observe, that perpetually to be asking God for things which we want, believing that this is a way to obtain them, implies the belief that God is imperfect both in wisdom and goodness. Telling God unceasingly of our wants, implies that he needs to be told of them—otherwise it is an unmeaning ceremony. Asking Him continually to do things for us, implies our belief that otherwise he would not do them for us; in other words, our belief, either that God will not do what is right, if he be not begged and entreated to do so—or that, by being begged and entreated, he can be induced to do what is wrong.
In like manner, in regard to praise, which is the other element of what is called prayer: first, what use can there be in our telling the Divine Being, that he has such and such qualities; as if he was like to mistake his own qualities, by some imperfection in his knowledge, which we supply? next, what a mean and gross conception of the Divine nature is implied in supposing that, like the meanest of men, God is delighted in listening to his own praises! Surely, practices which have this tendency, if they are considered as having any meaning at all, it is much better to consider as having no meaning—that is, as being mere ceremonies.
The Divine Author of our religion every where indicates his opinion, that praying is nothing but a ceremony: he particularly marks praying, as one among the abuses of that sect among his countrymen, who carried their religious pretensions the highest, and whom he considered it his duty to reprobate as the most worthless class of men in the nation.
It is matter worthy of particular remark, that Jesus no where lays stress on prayer as a duty: he rarely speaks of it otherwise than incidentally. With that condescension to the weakness and prejudices of his countrymen, which is every where observable in his conduct, he does not reprobate a practice, to which he knew they had the attachment of an invincible habit; but by placing it among the vices of the Pharisees, he indicated with tolerable clearness what he thought of it.
It would seem, if we take his own words and example for authority, not the interested interpretation of priests—that he actually forbade the use of prayer in public worship. Let us observe how he gave warning against the abuse of this ceremony, in the sermon on the mount, and how clearly and incontrovertibly he characterized it as a ceremony, and nothing else: Edition: current; Page: [263] ‘And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogue’ (that is, in public worship) ‘and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet; and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.’
Nothing can be clearer than this: all prayer is reprobated but secret prayer, and even that is not recommended. The words always are, ‘when ye pray’—that is, if ever ye do pray, do it in secret, the whole turn of the expression being permissive only, not injunctive. It is remarkable, with respect to this limitation of prayer to secret prayer only, that Jesus himself never makes a prayer on any public occasion; and as often as he is represented in the Gospels as praying, which is very rarely, he withdraws even from his disciples, and does it in absolute solitude. Jesus goes on—‘But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye, therefore, like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.’
This last expression is of peculiar force and significance: Be not ye like those who think they will be heard for their much speaking; since speaking at all is of no use; ‘your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.’ Can there be a more distinct declaration, that prayer is a ceremony only, and not very easy to be kept from being a hurtful ceremony?
Jesus subjoins to this declaration of the ceremonial nature of prayer these words—‘After this manner, therefore, pray ye;’ and then comes the formulary called the Lord’s Prayer, evidently intended as a pattern to prevent the excesses into which the ceremony was apt to run. And the words of the pattern itself, taken in combination with the words spoken immediately before—‘Your heavenly Father knoweth,’ &c.—afford sufficient evidence, when they are minutely examined, of the character in which its Divine Author meant it should be used.
But, as it is too evident to need any illustration that the idea of the Divine Being, as a being of perfect wisdom and goodness, so steadily and luminously fixed in the mind, as to be a principle of action, is the very essence of religion, and the sole source of all the good impressions we derive from it, it is not less evident, that every idea instilled into us, which implies imperfection in the Divine Being, is a perversion of the religious principle, and so far as it goes, converts it into a principle Edition: current; Page: [264] of evil. Because, exactly in so far as men set up for the object of their worship a being who falls short of perfect wisdom and goodness, so far they manufacture to themselves a motive for the practice of what is contrary to wisdom and goodness. Yet it is self-evident, that to offer petitions to the Divine Being, with the idea that they will have any effect—that every thing, being already ordered for the best, will not proceed in the same way exactly as if no such petition had been made, is to suppose the petitioner either wiser or better than his Maker—either knowing better what is fit to be done, or more in earnest about the doing of it.
If these observations about the ceremonial nature of prayer be admitted, there is not occasion to say much about the rest of the Sunday service. Where is the use of a priest to read a chapter of the Bible, which every head of a family does to those who live in his house? Besides, the Church of England always reads the same chapters, thereby inevitably converting the operation into a ceremony. Are these the only chapters in the Bible which deserve to be read? If not, why read them only, casting a slur upon the rest? Again, when any thing has been read sufficiently often to have fixed the purport of it indelibly in the mind, what is the use of more repetition? It is evidently ceremonial only. With regard to the Communion service, we think it is, among protestants, considered as a ceremony. Mr. Bentham has endeavoured to show that it was never intended, either by Jesus or his disciples, to be permanent, even as a ceremony, and that it is peculiarly ill-fitted for that purpose; and we have never met with any thing like an answer to his observations, which well deserve the attention of all rational and honest-minded Christians.
And now we come to the Sermon, the only part of the Sunday performance, which is not essentially ceremonial; but which may, by misperformance, become not only ceremonial, like the rest, but positively and greatly mischievous.
A celebrated wit of the last age, known by the familiar name of George Selwyn, had gone one day to church, and was asked when he returned, by some one in the family to which he was on a visit, of what sort the sermon had been? ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘like other sermons; palavering God Almighty; and bullragging the devil.’ This was said, of course, satirically; and it must be added, considering the subject, that it was said profanely. But, nevertheless, it must be confessed, that it describes with great point the character of at least one grand class of Church of England Sermons, which consist of terms of praise heaped unceasingly on the Divinity—terms of condemnation heaped as unceasingly on the Personification of Evil: as if there could be Edition: current; Page: [265] supposed to be an individual in a Christian congregation not already prepared to bestow laudatory epithets upon God, opprobrious epithets on the devil, as far as his power of language would permit him to go. As no congregation, therefore, could possibly be the better for hearing such a sermon, it is necessary to consider it as a mere ceremony.
Another grand class of Church of England sermons consists of what, to borrow (as we may here do without profaneness) the language of George Selwyn, we may call palavering the Church of England, and bullragging the Dissenters; ascribing good qualities without end to Church-of-Englandism—evil qualities, in equal proportion, to Dissenter-ism. This is not merely ceremonial, certainly; but we may safely pronounce it worse—something so bad, that hardly anything equal to it in atrocity can be conceived. It is making religion, which ought to be a principle of love among human beings, a principle of hatred; and that hatred turning upon what? The great line of distinction between moral good and evil? That by which He who is perfection is mainly distinguished from the Prince of Darkness? No, no! But upon some difference of opinion in matters of little importance, or some diversity in the use of ceremonies. Is not this to vilify, or rather to explode morality? setting above it such frivolous things, as sameness of belief in dubious matters, or sameness of performance in matters of ceremony? Is not this to renounce the good of mankind as the grand principle of action, the main point of obedience to the will of God—making the service of God a pretence for hostility to a large portion of his creatures? Is this a morality, fit to be promulgated by a man, miserably, or exorbitantly paid, in every parish in the kingdom? We restrain by punishment, and we do well, the publication of indecent books and prints, calculated to inflame the passions of the inexperienced and unwary. But these publications are innocent, compared with the sermons read to congregations, or printed for the public, to which we now allude.
The extent to which the exercise of this malignant principle is carried cannot, perhaps, be more clearly shown than by calling to mind that celebrated Charge to the clergy of London, by the then Right Reverend the Bishop of London, the present Most Reverend the Archbishop of Canterbury, to which Mr. Bentham makes such pointed allusion. ‘The prostration of the understanding and the will,’ there spoken of as one of the desiderata, one of the objects of desire, and of endeavour, to the Church of England, Mr. Bentham has commented on with his usual fulness and usual effect. And all that is necessary for Edition: current; Page: [266] us, in regard to that generous purpose, is, to refer our readers to the treat prepared for them in his comment.* Another expression in the said Charge—is that to which we desire to direct the reader’s attention in this place. We borrow the expression from Mr. Bentham, other means of reference not being at hand, but with perfect confidence, knowing, as we do, what his care of accuracy in such particulars was. ‘In the Charge,’ says Mr. Bentham, ‘we shall see Non-Church-of-Englandists marked out as “enemies” and men of “guilt.” ’—Why, in the name of all that is good, should Church of England men treat as ‘enemies’ all men who cannot subscribe the Thirty-Nine Articles, or join in the performance of their ceremonies? Is not this to make religion the curse of human nature—the permanent fountain of discord—the extinguisher of love and of peace? Not to subscribe the Thirty-nine Articles, and not to join in certain ceremonies is ‘guilt!’ This is to make the Church-of-Englandman the general enemy of his species. Sermons, which propagate this idea, propagate a feeling of hatred, a disposition of hostility, towards all men but those of their own particular sect. Is not this to renounce the religion of Jesus, which is a religion of peace? Is not this Antichrist? Is not this to deny the Lord that bought them?—to crucify him in the house of his friends? Assuredly sermons of this cast had better not be delivered.
Another class of sermons are the controversial: those which undertake to settle points of dogmatic divinity. We believe that all rational men are united in opinion, that such discourses, addressed to ordinary congregations, can be of no use, and have a strong tendency to be hurtful. They have a direct tendency to attach undue importance to uniformity of belief on points on which it is not necessary. They have also a direct tendency to lower men’s ideas of the Divine character—representing the Almighty as favouring those who adhere to one side in the controversy, hostile to those who adhere to the other. This is to suborn belief; to create in those who yield to such teaching a habit of forcing a belief; that is, of dealing dishonestly with their own convictions. To hold out rewards for believing one way, punishment for believing another way, is to hold out inducements to resist the force of evidence, on the one side, and lend to it a weight which does not belong to it, on the other. This is a mode of attaching belief to any opinions, however unfounded; and as soon as a man is thoroughly broken in to this mental habit, not only is the power of sound judgment destroyed within him, but the moral character does not escape Edition: current; Page: [267] uninjured. The man in whose breast this habit is created, never sees anything in an opinion, but whether it is agreeable to his interest or not. Whether it is founded on evidence or not, he has been trained to neglect. Truth or falsehood in matters of opinion is no longer with him the first consideration.
This is nearly the most immoral state of mind which can have existence in a human being. No other cause of criminal actions is of equal potency with this. A man in this state of mind has an opinion ready to justify him in any profitable course of villany in which he can engage. How great a proportion of Church of England teaching, in pulpits, in schools, and in universities, has this tendency, and no other, is a subject of immense importance, and to which we must recur on future occasions. Oh, for a Pascal! Oh, for a new set of Provincial Letters!
We shall pass by the other subdivisions of sermons, and come to the moral. Though a man of the proper stamp, residing among his fellow parishioners, would have other and still more effectual means of making the impressions on their minds which lead to good conduct, we do not dispute that a discourse of the proper kind, delivered to them when assembled on the day of rest, would have happy effects. In the first place, it would establish in their minds pure ideas of the moral character of God; and would root out of them every notion which implies imperfection in the Divine Mind. This is a matter of infinite importance, though neglected, or rather trampled upon by Church of England religion; for exactly in proportion as the model which men set up for imitation is perfect or imperfect, will be the performance which takes place in consequence. It is unavailing, it is poor childishness, to call the Almighty benevolent, when you ascribe to him lines of action which are entirely the reverse. It is vain to call him wise, when you represent him as moved by considerations which have weight with only the weakest of men.
We have already seen something of the extent to which the religion of the Church of England tends to imprint the notion of imperfection, both of the moral and intellectual kind, in the character of the Deity. But there is one particular to which we have hardly as yet adverted, which deserves the deepest attention. We mean the notions propagated about punishments after death.
No wise and good man ever thinks of punishment but as an undesirable means to a desirable end; and therefore to be applied in the smallest quantity possible. To ascribe to the Edition: current; Page: [268] Divine Being the use of punishments in atrocious excess; not applying it according to the rules of the most perfect benevolence, which is its character in the hand of a virtuous man, but in the spirit of revenge, and to vindicate his dignity, is to ascribe to him, not the character of a civilized man, but of an atrocious savage. Nor is the excess of future punishments the only point of importance. The uselessness of them also deserves the utmost regard in tracing the ways in which priests, for their own ends, have perverted men’s notions of the Divine character. Punishment is employed by virtuous men for the prevention of hurtful actions. But what is the use of punishment when the time of action is gone by, and when the doom of the wretched victim is fixed for ever? It is said that the apprehension of these punishments is a restraint on men during their lives. But to make this allegation is only another mode of ascribing imperfection, both intellectual and moral, to the Supreme Being.
It is a certain and undisputed principle, that proximity of punishment is necessary to its efficiency; that if a punishment is distant, and hence the conception of it faint, it loses proportionally of its force. As it is the great rule of benevolence to be sparing in the use of punishment—that is, to employ it in the smallest possible quantity which will answer the end—it is the constant aim of benevolence to make it as proximate as possible—that is, to make the smallest possible quantity suffice. What would be thought of a legislator, who should ordain, that the punishment of murder and theft should not take place till twenty years, or so, after the commission of the crime; and that, for the distance of the time, compensation should be made in the severity of the punishment? Is not this the atrocity into which those theologians sink, who tell us that the punishments of hell are intended for the prevention of evil in the present life? That this theory is not derived from the Scripture, but is the pure forgery of priests, might be inferred with certainty à priori, and could also be easily proved by particular evidence. But the authority of Bishop Butler will be sufficient for us on the present occasion. He has given it as his opinion, an opinion which has never been accused as unscriptural, that the change from the present to the future life will not, in all probability, be greater, than the change from the state which precedes, to that which follows the birth; that the individual will pass into the future life with all the dispositions and habits which he had acquired in his previous course, producing misery to him if they are bad, happiness if they are good; but with this advantage, that the circumstances in which he will be placed will have an irresistible tendency to correct bad habits, and encourage good Edition: current; Page: [269] ones, whence, in time, it will be brought about, that none but good habits will exist, and happiness will be universal.
Next to the propagation of correct notions regarding the character of the Supreme Being, as the perfection of wisdom and goodness, with warnings against all such notions as imply imperfection in the Divine nature, the object of discourses, calculated to be of real utility to the majority of those who compose congregations, would be, to make, and as deeply as possible, all the impressions which lead to good conduct; to give strength and constancy to the kindly and generous feelings; to stimulate the desire of doing good, by showing the value of it, and the amount of good which even a very poor man may effect, in the course of his life, if he seizes the many little occasions which he will find put in his way; to make understood and felt the value of a good name; how much of the happiness of each individual depends upon the good-will of those among whom he lives; and that the sure way of obtaining it is to show by his acts his good-will to them. Such discourses would put the people on their guard against the misleading affections; would make them understand how much is lost by giving way to them; and with what a preponderance of good, even to ourselves, they are supplanted by those which lead us to rejoice in being the instruments of happiness to others. Above all things, such discourses would make parents clearly understand, and acutely feel, the power they have over the happiness or misery of their children, during the whole course of their lives. On the mode of creating in their children the habits on which their happiness depends, such discourses would enter into the most minute detail. They would carefully warn parents against every display of feeling or passion, every thing in word, or in action, having a tendency to produce an undesirable impression on the tender mind; and would give them an habitual conviction, and, as it were, a sense, of the importance of making none but the right impressions.
It is not necessary to go farther in illustrating what sermons of the useful class would be. It is only necessary to recollect what the moral class of Church of England sermons are. Other people may have been more fortunate than we; but though we have heard a good many of that class, we never heard one which we thought good for anything. They may be characterized as a parcel of vapid commonplaces, delivered in vague and vapouring phrases, having not even a tendency to give men more precise ideas of the good they may do, or to kindle within them a more strong and steady desire of performing it. We have often asked ourselves, after hearing such Edition: current; Page: [270] a sermon, whether any human being could by possibility have received one useful impression from it; whether any one could have gone away after hearing it a better man than when he came; in the least degree more alive to the motives to good conduct, more capable of resisting the motives to bad? Never, in a single instance, do we remember having been able to make an answer in the affirmative. For a confirmation of the opinion we have thus formed of Church of England sermonizing, we appeal to the printed specimens of them, some of which are by men of considerable ability, skilful advocates of a cause, acute and eloquent controvertists, but all of them defective, or rather utterly worthless, in moral teaching.
We have now probably said enough to show how entirely of the ceremonial kind, and ceremonial with more or less of a hurtful tendency, the whole of the Sunday services obligatory on the Church of England clergyman are.
All that remains is the ceremony of baptism, the ceremony of marriage, and the ceremony of burying the dead. These services are so much regarded in the light of ceremonies, that they commonly go by that name.
The Church of England indeed pretends, that baptism washes away original sin; one of those cherished opinions by which it ascribes weakness, both intellectual and moral, to the Supreme Being. In this opinion it is reprobated by other churches, as retaining one of the errors of the Romish Church. For the rest, it cannot be pretended that it is other than ceremonial. To the infant, who knows nothing about the matter, it would be ridiculous to suppose that any good is done. And what can it be pretended is the good which it does to any other body? For a full exposure of the Church of England proceedings in respect to baptism, we refer to what is said by Mr. Bentham in his Examination of Church of England Catechism, pp. 47 to 59, where the reader will find both instruction and amusement.
About marriage it is not necessary to say much. It is in its essence a civil contract; and few rational men think that the religious ceremony is of any importance. It is very certain that nobody regards it as any security for the better performance of the duties which the contract implies.
The burial service consists in reading certain portions of Scripture and certain prayers. But to whom can this performance be considered as being of any use? Not certainly to the dead man; and certainly not to any of the living, excepting those who are present. And who are they? Hardly any body; some half-dozen of the dead man’s nearest connexions being Edition: current; Page: [271] excepted. If the ceremony were believed to be of any use to those who witness the performance of it, means ought to have been employed to bring the people together for that purpose. No such means have ever been thought of. What does that declare? One of two things. Either that the Church of England clergy are utterly indifferent to the good which the witnessing of it is calculated to produce; or that they do not believe it is calculated to do any good at all.
We have thus examined in some detail the duties which are exacted of the Church of England clergy, and the only duties which they can be really considered as performing. The duties, the enforcement of which is left to conscience, to the desire of doing good, in the breast of the individual, are for the most part neglected, and never otherwise than ill-performed. We are far from denying that there are good men among the working clergy of the Church of England, notwithstanding the obstruction to goodness which their situation creates; men who reside among their parishioners, go about among them, and take pains to do them good. But these are the small number; and they never act systematically and upon a well-digested plan. They are left, unguided, to follow their own impulses; and often a great part of their well-meant endeavours is thrown away. They receive no instruction in the art of doing good. This is no part of Church of England education. Yet it is an art towards the perfection of which instruction is of first-rate importance. Few men are aware of the whole extent of their means in that respect; and still fewer judge accurately in what applications of their means they will prove the most productive. It follows, as a necessary consequence, that the amount of good which a well-intentioned man produces is often very short of what, if better directed, he would have been able to effect.
Thus employed, and thus paid, is it any wonder that the Church of England clergy should have lost their influence among a people improving, now at last improving rapidly, in knowledge and intelligence? And when a clergy have lost their influence, what is the use of them? The evidence of their total loss of influence is very striking, when it is fairly looked at and considered. The first fact is the notorious one, that one-half of the population have renounced them as utterly unfit to be their religious guides, and have chosen others of their own. This fact speaks inferences far beyond the numerical proportions. The Dissenters afford evidence of their being in earnest about their religion. The Established Church is the natural sink of all those who are indifferent about it, and belong to a church for the sake of the name, as long as there is any thing Edition: current; Page: [272] to be got by it. To this number may be added all those whose lives are too scandalous to let them be admitted into any other Christian society. Now, if we say that not more than every other man in a community is in earnest about religion, we shall not perhaps be considered as making a very unreasonable supposition. But if this be anything like an approximation to the fact, the members of the Church of England are almost wholly men who adhere to it either for the sake of the name, or for the good things which they owe to it, with a small proportion indeed of those in whose adherence to it regard for religion has any thing to do. The Church of England therefore exists in no other character than that of a state engine; a ready and ever-willing instrument in the hands of those who desire to monopolize the powers of government—that is, to hold them for the purpose of abusing them.
It is useful to mark, among the proofs that the Church of England exists for no good purpose, that those of the common people who brutalize themselves with intoxicating liquors belong almost wholly to the Church of England sect. A Dissenter is rarely a notorious drunkard, with whatever other sins he may be tainted. The coster-mongers are never Dissenters. It would be important to put means in operation to show what proportion of the people convicted of crime are Churchmen, and what Dissenters. Our conjecture would be, that nine in ten at least are of the Church of England. It would be easy to ascertain what proportion of parish paupers are Church of England men, and what Dissenters. And that, too, would be no insignificant article of evidence.
Though such, however, is the light in which the Church of England, in its present state, must appear to every intelligent and honest inquirer, we know what a clamor will be raised against us for expressing our opinion, by all those who derive their profit from what is evil in things as they are; who are therefore attached to the evil, and bitterly hostile to all who seek to expose it. With the reasonable and the sincere, we need no other protection than the evidence we adduce. With others, it may have some effect, to show them what eminent men before us have said of the clergy, and of the inevitable effect of the position in which they are placed, by a viciously constructed establishment.
Dr. Middleton, one of the greatest men whom the Church of England ever produced, has spoken of one of the most deplorable of the effects of their position, their hostility to the interests of truth, in the following terms:—

‘Every man’s experience will furnish instances of the wretched fruits Edition: current; Page: [273] of this zeal, in the bigoted, vicious, and ignorant part, both of the clergy and the laity; who, puffed up with the pride of an imaginary orthodoxy, and detesting all free inquiry, as dangerous to their case, and sure to expose their ignorance, take pleasure in defaming and insulting men of candor, learning, and probity, who happen to be touched with any scruples, or charged with any opinions which they call heretical*.’

One of the most respectable names to be found in the list of Church of England clergy is Jeremy Taylor. He speaks to the same effect, in the following terms:—

‘Possibly men may be angry at me, and my design; for I do all them great displeasure, who think no end is then well served, when their interest is disserved†.’
Opinions are called heresies, upon interest, and the grounds of emoluments‡.’
Our opinions commence and are upheld, according as our turns are served and our interests are preserved§.’

To return again to Middleton, who saw this malignant disease of the Church of England with peculiar clearness:—

‘I do not know how to account for that virulence of zeal, with which it [the Free Inquiry] is opposed by those writers, but by imputing it to their prejudices or habitual bigotry, or to some motives especially of interest; which, of course, bars all entrance to opinions, though ever so probable, if not stamped by an authority which can sweeten them with rewards∥.’

Nothing is of more importance than the repeated, and earnest, consideration of the fact, that the interest of a clergy, in the circumstances in which the Church of England clergy are placed, is in direct opposition to their duty, and makes them sworn enemies of the good of their fellow creatures. They are hired, for the purpose of propagating a certain set of opinions. They are sworn to retain them: that is, to keep their minds stationary in at least one department of thought. And it is curious to observe how far that creates a motive to exert themselves to keep the minds of other men stationary, not in that department only, but in all the departments of thought; to make the clergy the enemies of all improvement of the human mind. If one set of men stand still in this improvement, while other men go on, these men see that they will soon become objects of contempt. They are sworn to stand still; they, therefore, detest all those who go on, and exert themselves to impede their progress, and to discredit their design.
Edition: current; Page: [274]
This motive has a cruel extent of operation. To be bound to stand still, in any line of mental improvement, is a state of great degradation. The progress of other men in knowledge gives them a keener sense of this degradation. The clergy therefore perceive, that, in proportion as other men grow wiser, they will sink deeper in contempt. This gives them a hatred of the pursuit of knowledge. The search of truth bodes them evil, and not good; and therefore all their art is employed to prevent it.
We think, however, that by changes—far from violent, the Church of England might be converted from an instrument of evil into an instrument of much good; and to the consideration of this part of the subject we now proceed.
We consider a local clergy, distributed everywhere among the people, as the fundamental part of an institute really intended for moulding the character of the people, and shaping their actions, according to the spirit of pure religion. The question then is, what is required towards obtaining in greatest amount the beneficial services capable of being derived from such a set of men.
The very first particular which comes to be noticed, shows in what a different spirit from that of good to the people every thing relating to the Church of England has been arranged. It is very clear, that in employing men to the best advantage in any sort of service, each individual should have enough to do, and not more than enough. This care has been wholly renounced by Church of Englandism, which exhibits the most enormous disproportions; in one place, parishes far too large for any individual to manage; in other places so small, that a man has little to do in them. A good establishment would correct this abominable instance of careless and profligate management.
Next, the men who are to direct the people in the right path, and make them walk in it as diligently as possible, should be men capable of doing their work well: that is, they should, at least, be men of good education and good character. To this end, it is absolutely necessary that they should receive sufficient pay, to be an inducement to men of that description to undertake the duties. There is evidence enough to prove that this need not be high. We do not adduce the curates; because the baneful lottery of the over-paid places in the Church draws into it too great a number of adventurers. But the medical men, of whom one is to be found in every considerable village, afford evidence to the point, and that conclusive. Besides, the situation would be one of great consideration and dignity, as Edition: current; Page: [275] soon as it came to be regarded as a source of great utility; and men with property of their own would be desirous of filling it. The situation of judges in France is strong evidence to this point. The pay is so small, that the wonder of Englishmen always is, how any body can be found to accept the situation; yet the fact is, that it is in request; and the problem is solved, by learning that men, having a moderate property of their own, covet the dignity which the office confers.
Thus far we have proceeded with no difficulty, and with very little room for doubt; but having determined the sort of men we ought to have, we come next to the question by whom, in each instance, ought they to be appointed. Three considerations obviously enter into the solution of this question—the best means of securing honesty in the selection—the best means of giving satisfaction to the parishioners, without incurring the evils of a mistaken choice—the not giving too much power to one individual. The best chance, perhaps, for having honesty and intelligence in the selection, would be to have a Minister of Public Instruction, by whom all the appointments should be made. He would act under a stronger sense of responsibility, conspicuously placed, as he would be, under the eye of the public, than any other man; and in the majority of cases, would not have any interest in acting wrong. But this would be a great amount of patronage, possibly too great to exist without danger in any single hand; and it is not easy to find an unexceptionable mode of distribution. Suppose the patronage were in each county given to the principal civil authority in the county, he would be exposed to all the local influences which are known to be so adverse to the virtuous use of patronage; and acting in a corner with very little of the salutary influence of publicity, where the choice was not made by favouritism, it would be very apt to be made in negligence.
Suppose, however, that this difficulty is got over (it would interrupt us too much at present to show that it is not insurmountable), we may assume, that where provision is made for the appointment of a fit minister in every parish, complete provision is made for the religious instruction and guidance of the people—provided we can depend upon the due discharge of the duties which those ministers are appointed to perform. It has, however, been generally believed, that the due discharge of the duties of the parochial ministers cannot be depended upon without superintendence. A question then arises, what is the best contrivance for the superintendence of a parochial clergy?
Two methods have been thought of, and are at the present hour in operation: the one is, superintendence by individual Edition: current; Page: [276] clergymen; the other is, superintendence by assemblies, in which clergy and laity are combined. One question is, which of these two methods is the best? and another question is, whether there may not be a third, which is better than either?
The two methods which are now in practice are exemplified respectively in the churches of England and Scotland. In England the scheme of superintendence by individuals has been tried, in Scotland that of superintendence by assemblies.
If we were to judge by the event, in these two instances, the question would be decided very rapidly. The Scottish system is proved by experience to have answered, and not very imperfectly, its end, while it occasions no expense whatsoever. The English system is at once disgracefully expensive, and totally inefficient to its end: it is an absolute failure, with an enormous burthen to the nation.
We hardly suppose that the proposition we have thus announced respecting those two churches will be disputed in regard to either. The general good conduct of the Scottish clergy, and the absence of flagrant abuses in that church, is matter of notoriety. The lamentable want of good conduct, though not universal, among the English clergy, and the existence of enormous abuses in their church, is matter of not less notoriety. There is no non-residence in Scotland, and no pluralities. Would such things have ever begun to exist in England, if the superintendence by bishops had been good for anything? The proportional amount of Dissenterism in Scotland is small, compared with what it is in England; and has arisen almost wholly from the people’s dislike of patronage—a matter over which the clergy had no control, and of which the consequences are not to be imputed to them. There is nothing of the sort to screen the English clergy; and the enormous extent of Dissenterism in England is evidence—is proof, invincible proof—that the clergy have not done their duty.
It is not, however, safe to ground a general conclusion upon individual instances, unless where the reason—the rationale of the instances, applies to other cases. With respect to superintendence by individuals, the mode of it adopted in England is so glaringly absurd, so little reference has it to any rational purpose, that it never can have been intended to be an instrument of good—to be a means of obtaining from the local clergy the greatest amount of useful service to the people at large. The pay alone is perfect evidence to that effect. Who ever thinks of getting laborious service from a man on whom is bestowed an enormous income, which incessantly invites him to the enjoyment of voluptuous indolence, without any efficient Edition: current; Page: [277] call for exertion? Nor is this the only baneful effect of these enormous incomes: they created a line of separation between the superintending and the superintended clergy. They constituted them two castes; and well is it known how their conduct has conformed itself to the distinction. A principle of repulsion was created between them: often enough, it is true, commuted for prostitute servility on the part of the lower caste; and thus morality, by Church of England culture, was propagated and flourished. There could rarely be any cordial communication between two classes of men placed in such relation to one another. No bishop has an intimate knowledge of the character or turn of mind of any, except an accidental individual or two, among those whom he superintends. He does not go about into the several parishes, to see and inquire how the clerical duties are performed; he knows nothing at all about the matter, unless some extraordinary instance of misconduct, which makes all the country ring, should come to his ears.
Nor could it be otherwise. Natural causes produce their natural effects. A bishop was intended to be a great lord: of course he would be governed by the impulses which govern other great lords. Not one of these impulses is to go about parishes, seeing whether clergymen have been as effectual as they might, in training the people under their tuition to bring their children up well.
The very pretext of any such duty as this is absurd, when we recollect that these reverend lords have to be absent from their business of superintendence of their clergy for one full half of their time, by attendance on their duties (so by an abuse of language they are called) in parliament.
As we have seen how it is with the ordinary clergy of the Church of England—that of the two classes of their duties, one the ceremonial, another the useful, it is the ceremonial only which means are used to make them perform—the useful are left to themselves to perform, or not perform, as they please; so it is exactly with the bishops. There are certain ceremonies they have to go through: these are obligatory on them. The duty of vigilantly looking after their clergy—of using means to get them to do whatever it is in their power to do, to make their people more virtuous and more happy—is left to the bishops to do, or not do, as they please; and accordingly it never is done—at least, to any purpose: by the greater part of them it is never thought of.
But it does not follow, because the plan of superintendence by individuals was so ill-constructed by the Church of England as to make it a source of evil and not of good, that therefore it Edition: current; Page: [278] is in itself, and radically, bad. We are inclined to think that it is radically good, and might be so contrived as to be superior to the Scottish method.
We do not think that an assembly is well fitted for minute inspection; and that is the only inspection which is sure of answering its end. An assembly cannot go about visiting parishes, and ascertaining on the spot where the clergyman has been to the greatest degree, where to the lowest degree, useful to his parishioners.
But if we are to employ individual inspectors (the name bishop means inspector) by what scheme is the greatest amount of good to be obtained from them?
One thing is perfectly clear: you must not over-pay them. An inspector, to be useful, must be a hard-working man: that a very rich man never is. This is an established rule, though it does not altogether exclude exceptions. They should be paid higher than the parochial clergy, because they should be men of such high character and attainments as might give weight to their decisions. Still the business of an inspecting priest is so much of the same kind, with the business of a parochial priest, that the pay of the one should be a sort of criterion by which to regulate that of the other. If the highest pay of a parish priest were, say, 500l. per annum, we think 1000l. per annum should be the highest pay of an inspector; for we allow no weight whatsoever to the pretence which is set up with characteristic impudence by the friends of public plunder, that wealth gives efficiency to superintendence. It does no such thing. A man will pull off his hat with more hurry, will bend his body lower, will speak in a softer tone, before the man of great wealth; but he will not trouble himself to do his bidding one atom the more for his riches. Is any man, so nearly deprived of intellect, as still, though grown to be a man, to need evidence on this point? Let him see how the rich are served, even in their own houses. Are they better served than those among us whose riches are less? Do we not know that the men best served in their houses are not the richest, but the most sensible men?
There is another thing to be regarded in the matter of pay, which though it appear small intrinsically, is great by its mode of operation on the human mind. It is infinitely better that the clergy should be paid in the way of salary than in the way of estate. Between the idea of salary, and the idea of service to be performed for it, the association is close and strong. Between the idea of living on the proceeds of an estate, and the idea of having nothing to do, the association is equally powerful. And so it must be. In all our experience, we regularly Edition: current; Page: [279] observe that salary and service go together. We see that commonly estate and service have no connexion. Hence it comes, that a man who lives upon an estate seems to himself to share in the common privilege of those who live upon estates; that is, to enjoy himself. No man who has studied the human mind will doubt that this is a matter of the greatest importance. If the Church of England clergy had always been paid by salary, we may be assured they would not have sunk into the state of absolute uselessness in which we now behold them.
It is unnecessary to dwell upon the scheme of paying the clergy by that particular kind of estate called tithe, because people now pretty well understand it. Of all conceivable schemes for setting the interest and the duties of the clergy in direct opposition, this is the most perfect. And it makes a fearful revelation. It proves, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the clergy, and all those who through so long a series of ages have had in their hands the power of regulating the payment of the clergy, have been void even of the desire that the clergy should be useful. Oh, what an odious thing is the pretence of caring for religion in the mouths of such men! Contrast an establishment of men whose business it would be to go about their parishes, planting themselves in the hearts of their people, and working upon their minds to the performing of all good actions, and the acquiring of all good habits, with an establishment of men who go about their parishes, indeed, but go about raping and rending, demanding what others are unwilling to pay, carrying strife and hatred along with them, looked at by their people in the light of enemies, not of friends, the very sight of whom is odious, and in whose mouths advice to their parishioners to be mutually forbearing and helpful could only be treated with ridicule; and say if the imagination of man can present any two things of a more opposite character. Reflect also deliberately who the men are who have so long strained their lungs, and now do, proclaiming that this church is ‘most excellent.’ What a help-meet it must have been for misrule to earn all the protection which it has received! That on any other score it has deserved it, there is hardly impudence enough in the world now to pretend.
But if it were determined that good inspection and stimulation were more to be expected from individual superintendents, properly paid and employed, than from assemblies, another question would remain to be answered: whether these inspectors should be clergymen or laymen? There are some reasons for thinking that laymen would be the best. They would be less under the influence of that feeling which men of a class commonly contract, and which makes them willing to favour Edition: current; Page: [280] one another, to make them sympathise with their self-indulgences, and to screen their neglects. If it be surmised that such men would be less acquainted than clergymen with the supposed science of the theologians, we answer, that if it were so, and it is by no means necessary that it should be so, for that science is easily learned, it would not, upon our scheme, be a matter of much importance. For we do not mean that our parochial clergy should trouble their parishioners with dogmas. Their business will be to train them in the habits of a good life; and what is necessary to that will be judged of fully as well by a layman as by a clergyman.
We have now supposed, that a well-selected person from the class of educated men has been placed as the minister of religion in every conveniently-sized district, called a parish. This we consider as the fundamental part of a religious establishment. We have next supposed that a well-selected person from the class of men of superior acquirements and intelligence has been appointed the inspector and superintendent of a convenient number of clergymen everywhere throughout the country. We have also spoken a little of the duties of each, but it is necessary to speak somewhat more in detail.
In the first place, it is a fundamental part of our scheme, that a clergy, paid by the state, should, in their instruction of the people, abstain entirely from the inculcation of dogmas. The reasons are conclusive. They cannot inculcate dogmas without attaching undue importance to uniformity of belief in doubtful matters; that is, classing men as good or bad on account of things which have no connexion with good conduct; that is, without derogating from morality, and lessening its influence on the minds of men.
They cannot inculcate dogmas—at least they never do—without attaching merit, and the rewards which belong to it, to belief on one side of a question; that is, without suborning belief, using means to make it exist independently of evidence; that is, to make men hold opinions without seeing that they are true—in other words, to affirm that they know to be true what they do not know to be true; that is, if we may give to the act its proper name—to lie. But a clergy, paid for teaching the people to live well, should assuredly not do what has a tendency to make them habitual liars.
To preach the importance of dogmas, is to teach men to impute imperfection to the Divine nature. It is according to the perfections of the Divine nature to approve in his rational creatures the love of truth. But the love of truth leads a man to search for evidence, and to place his belief on that side, whatsoever it be, on which the evidence appears to him to preponderate. Edition: current; Page: [281] The clergyman who tells him that God likes best belief on one side, declares to him that God does not like the honest search of truth. Oh God! with what perseverance and zeal has this representation of thy Divine nature been maintained, by men who, with the same breath, and therefore in the spirit of base adulation, were calling thee the God of truth!
Upon this ground it surely is proper to interdict the use of articles. The Articles of the Church of England are a set of propositions, the strangeness of which we shall not dilate upon. That, and the history of them, are both pretty well known. The clergy of the Church of England subscribe them as propositions which they are bound to believe. Anything more fraught with injury to the intellectual and moral parts of man’s nature cannot be conceived. This is to make men enemies to truth.
We shall not repeat, what we have so immediately said, and what we are sure must make a deep impression on every untainted mind, on the atrocity of giving men inducements to make a belief, which they have not derived from evidence. The subscription of articles goes beyond this. It vouches for future belief. It is a bond, that the individual subscribing shall for ever after set his mind against the admission of evidence; that is, resist the entrance of truth; in other words, make war upon it, in the only way in which war upon truth is capable of being made.
It is a deplorable fact,—which deserves the most profound attention, though hitherto it has not received it,—that the creation of effectual motives to the hatred of truth in one department, creates effectual motives to the hatred of it generally. We have touched upon this point already. But it deserves further development; for it stands first in point of importance.
The man who is reduced to the degraded condition of resisting truth, lives under the painful assurance that he will be held to be a degraded being, by every man who sets a high value on truth, and is eager in the pursuit of it. The pursuit of truth brings thus along with it a consequence most painful to him. He therefore dislikes it. He would prevent it, if he could; and he is stimulated to do all that he can to prevent it. If the love and pursuit of truth should become general, he sees clearly that he must become an object of general contempt. What a motive is this to him to prevent its becoming general; to smother it in the very birth, if he can!—See in what perfect obedience to this impulse the Church of England has always acted! Above all, explore minutely the cruel ways in which, to this end, it has abused its power over the business of education! The whole bent of its tuition is to make its pupils acquiesce Edition: current; Page: [282] slavishly in a parcel of traditional dogmas, and instead of awakening the desire of farther progress, to frighten them at the idea of it; training them to regard it as a source of boundless evil; and all those who pursue it, as villains, aiming at the destruction of whatever is valuable among mankind.
They have thus been constituted the enemies of their species. The advance of mankind in happiness has, by a nefarious constitution of their church, been made a source of evil to them. And they have been, as it was certain they would be, its strenuous, and, to a deplorable extent, we must add, its successful opponents.
The steadiness with which the priests of this establishment have persevered in this course, is a point of great interest in their history, and should be carefully set to view. We may make it the subject of a future article. The barefacedness with which it is professed, up to the present hour, and by some of the most respectable among them, amounts to a striking phenomenon. They even reprobate Locke, the cautious, the modest, the sober-minded Locke, for that which is even his greatest distinction, the trusting to evidence; the seeking after truth; the desiring to know something beyond the traditional propositions of others; the taking the only course which leads to the advancement of human knowledge, the improvement of the human mind, the progress of the race in happiness and virtue. Listen to what Copleston, then Head of a House, now bishop, and peer of parliament, thought it not disgraceful to him to say a few years ago. ‘His’ (Locke’s) ‘own opinions would have been entitled to greater respect,’ (observe for what) ‘if he had himself treated with more respect the opinions of those who had gone before him,’ (opinions, you see, are entitled to respect, not on account of the truth of them, but something else) ‘and the practice of sensible men of his own time, whose judgment was worth more, in proportion as it was confirmed by experience.’—Locke misbehaved, you see, by seeking for evidence, and yielding to it when found. Had he disregarded evidence, that is truth, and taken passively the opinions given to him, he would have merited the praise of Church of England priests; by taking the course he did, no wonder he has been always unpopular among them. ‘The light freedom, indeed, and the confidence with which this philosopher attacks all established notions, is one of the principal blemishes in his character.’—Is not this instar omnium? That is one of the principal blemishes in the character of one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived—so says Church of Englandism—which alone enabled him to do any good; namely, calling for evidence, marking where he did not find it, but only some man’s ipse dixit instead, and then Edition: current; Page: [283] proceeding honestly in search of it himself! Good God! what sort of a place of education is it, where such a course is held up, not for imitation, but reprobation?*
How vividly does this call to memory the description which Pope gives of the clergy of the Church of England, as being among the most zealous of the votaries of the Goddess of Dulness, and the education they impart in their schools and colleges the most efficient of all instruments for extending her empire!
In the description given in the second book of the Dunciad of the games instituted in honour of the goddess, whereof one was swimming and plunging in Fleet Ditch, a reverend gentleman having therein distinguished himself, is thus, and his brethren along with him, held up to observation:

‘Thence to the banks where reverend bards repose,
They led him soft; each reverend bard arose;
And Milbourn chief, deputed by the rest,
Gave him the cassock, surcingle, and vest.
“Receive,” he said, “those robes which once were mine,
Dulness is sacred in a sound divine.”
‘He ceased, and spread the robe; the crowd confess
The reverend Flamen in his lengthen’d dress.
Around him wide a sable army stand,
A low-born, cell-bred, selfish, servile band,
Prompt or to guard or stab, or saint or damn,
Heaven’s Swiss, who fight for any god or man.’

—347-358.


Such is the character of the race, drawn by the hand of our moral poet. Next we present his account of the debt of gratitude which education owes to them.

DUNCIAD, BOOK IV.
. . . ‘Since man from beast by words is known,
Words are man’s province; words we teach alone.
When reason, doubtful, like the Samian letter,
Points here two ways, the narrower is the better.
Placed at the door of learning, youth to guide,
We never suffer it to stand too wide.
To ask, to guess, to know, as they commence;
As fancy opens the quick springs of sense;
We ply the memory, we load the brain,
Bind rebel wit, and double chain on chain;
Confine the thought, to exercise the breath,
And keep them in the pale of words till death.
Whate’er the talents, or howe’er design’d,
We hang one jingling padlock on the mind.’

On the above passage is the following note: ‘A recapitulation of the whole course of modern education, described in this book, which confines youth to the study of words only in schools; subjects them to the authority of systems in the universities; and deludes them with the names of party distinction in the world.’
After being thus educated, they are delivered over to the magus of Dulness, Influence, ‘and then admitted,’ says the poet, in the Argument of the Book, ‘to taste the cup of the magus, her high priest, which causes a total oblivion of all obligation, divine, civil, moral, or rational; to these, her adepts, she sends priests, attendants, and comforters, of various kinds, confers on them orders and degrees,’ &c. The lines are—

‘Then take them all, oh take them to thy breast!
Thy magus, Goddess! shall perform the rest.
With that a wizard old his cup extends,
Which whoso tastes forgets his former friends,
Sire, ancestors, himself. One casts his eyes
Up to a star—and like Endymion dies:
A feather shooting from another’s head
Extracts his brain, and principle is fled:
Lost is his god, his country, everything;
And nothing left but homage to a king!
The vulgar herd turn off to herd with hogs,
To run with horses, or to hunt with dogs.’

—515.


On the passage ‘homage to a king,’ is the following note:—‘So strange as this must seem to a mere English reader, the famous M. de la Bruyere declares it to be the character of every good subject in a monarchy: “Where,” says he, “there is no such thing as love of our country, the interest, the glory, and service of the prince supply its place*.” Of this duty another celebrated French author speaks, indeed, a little more disrespectfully, which, for that reason, we shall not translate, but give in his own words: “L’amour de la patrie, le grand motif Edition: current; Page: [286] des premiers heros, n’est plus regardé que comme une chimêre; l’idée du service du roi, etendue jusqu’à l’oubli de tout autre principe, tient lieu de ce qu’on appelloit autrefois grandeur d’ame et fidelité*.”

‘But she, good goddess, sent to every child
Firm impudence, or stupefaction mild;
And straight succeeded, leaving shame no room,
Cibberian forehead, or Cimmerian gloom.’

A note on line 567 says: ‘This tribe of men, our poet hath elsewhere admirably characterized in that happy line,

‘ “A brain of feather, and a heart of lead.”

For the satire takes in the whole species of those, who, with an understanding too dissipated and futile for the offices of civil life, and a heart too lumpish, narrow, and contracted for those of social, become fit for nothing, and so turn wits and critics, where sense and civility are neither required nor expected.’
There is not a finer specimen of the arts of the clergy than their new-born zeal for the religious education of the children of the poor. The religious education of the children of the poor is not among the objects of the Church of England; there is no provision for it in that establishment; it was never a practice. Though the most eminently religious of all the possible functions of a minister of religion, a clergyman of the Church of England as little thought it belonged to him, as to make shoes for the children of his parishioners. Till the other day, there was in England no education for the children of the poor. They were absolutely uneducated, in religion, as in every thing else. During all the ages in which this state of things continued, the clergy saw no occasion for this religious education they are now so hot about. It is only when education in general, that is knowledge, begins to be, that they think education in religion is, required. Non-education in religion was not an evil, when in union with ignorance; in union with knowledge it becomes direful.—Can any body need help, in reading this passage of clergy?
So long as the people were in gross ignorance, their servility to their priests was to be depended upon. The moment light began to dawn upon them, it was, it seems, not to be expected, unless particular artifice was used. An expedient was fallen Edition: current; Page: [287] upon—that of clamouring for the union of religious education with other education.
This, in the first place, was a great impediment to education. It rendered it impossible for the children of people of different sects to be educated together. This was a capital stroke. It rendered the education of the people much more expensive, therefore much less likely to be carried into effect. It had other important consequences. It made all those benevolent individuals, whose partialities ran towards the Church, place the funds which they were disposed to contribute towards the education of the poor under the control of the Church, which was skilled in the art of giving education without instruction. From the evidence extracted by the committee of the House of Commons on Education, last year, it appears, that their endeavours in the National Schools are remarkable specimens of that art. They thus made sure of having all the children of those who nominally belong to the church in their own hands; and all the security against the desire of knowledge which education without instruction can yield.
The hollowness of the pretence is further seen in this, that all the education in religion which for ages the clergy thought necessary for the children of the poor, was only to make them able to repeat a few questions of the Catechism, before confirmation; and surely this it would not be difficult to attain, if they were educated in schools for all. What should hinder the parson of the parish (it is his business if any thing be), to assemble the children of his flock as often as needful, for the purpose of imparting to them much more religious instruction than this? That the clergy are not in earnest in their talk about the necessity of schooling in religion, is manifest from this, that they have done nothing to have it given. They have made use of the cry solely for the purpose of making schooling difficult. But where is the parson of a parish who takes the trouble to instruct the children of his parishioners in religion? Where is there one ordinance of the bishops rendering it imperative upon their clergy to fulfil the great duty of administering religious instruction to the young? The whole thing is a farce.
Having thus seen the importance of relieving the parochial ministers of religion from all concern with dogmas, we come to another question of no small importance, whether their labours of love should not also be relieved from the incumbrance of ceremonies?
The example of our Saviour shows, that in certain circumstances they cannot be dispensed with; that where the human Edition: current; Page: [288] mind is spell-bound in old habits, you cannot obtain access to it except through the medium of some of these habits.
We persuade ourselves, however, that we have attained in this country such a degree of advancement, notwithstanding the efforts of the Church of England to prevent it, that we may dispense with the performance of ceremonies on the part of those ministers of religion whom the state appoints for the pure purpose of making the people conform to the designs of a Being of perfect wisdom and goodness.
The importance would be immense of constituting a church without dogmas and ceremonies. It would be truly a Catholic church. Its ministers would be ministers of good, in the highest of all senses of the word, to men of all religious denominations. All would share in the religious services of such a church, and all would share in the blessings which would result from them. This is the true idea of a State religion; and there is no other. It ought to be stripped of all which is separating; of all that divides men from one another; and to present a point whereon, in the true spirit of reverence to the perfect being, and love to one another, they may all unite. So long as there are men who think dogmas and ceremonies a necessary part of religion, those who agree about such dogmas and ceremonies may have their separate and respective institutions of their own providing, for their inculcation and performance. But this is extraneous to the provisions which alone it is proper for the State to make, and which ought to be so contrived as to embrace, if it were possible, the whole population.
This, the scheme of which we have been endeavouring to convey the idea, we think, would effect. There is no class of Christians, who could not join in the labours of love of one who was going about continually doing good; whose more solemn addresses to his assembled parishioners would never have any other object than to assimilate them more and more in heart and mind to Him who is the author of all good, and the perfection of wisdom and benevolence. Men could not long attend a worship of this description, worship of the perfect being, by acts of goodness, without acquiring attachment to it, and learning by degrees that it is the one thing needful. All would belong to this church; and after a short time would belong to no other. Familiarized with the true worship of the Divine Being, they would throw off the pseudo worship, dogmas and ceremonies. This is the true plan for converting Dissenters. There would be no schism, if men had nothing to scind about.
If the ministers of the Established Church had nothing to Edition: current; Page: [289] do with dogmas, and nothing to do with ceremonies, how would we have them employed?
We have already expressed the general idea of their employment. It would be assiduous endeavour to make all the impressions on the minds of their parishioners which conduce to good conduct; not merely negative, in abstaining from ill; but positive, in doing all the good to one another which the means put in their power enable them to do.
It is very evident, that rules for the making of those all-important impressions cannot be given. General rules would be too vague to be of any use; and the variety of differing cases is so great, that it can only be met by the resources of zeal and discretion in the daily intercourse between the minister and the individuals of his flock. There are, however, certain things which may be assumed as tests, in each instance, of the manner in which the duties of the parochial minister are performed, and which afford a guide to the manner in which stimulants may be applied to him.
For example; we would give annual premiums to those ministers in whose parishes certain favourable results were manifested—in whose parishes there was the smallest number of crimes committed within the year—in whose parishes there was the smallest number of law-suits—in whose parishes there was the smallest number of paupers—in whose parishes there was the smallest number of uneducated children—in whose parishes the reading-rooms were best attended, and supplied with the most instructive books. We mention these as specimens. If there were any other results of the same kind; of which the evidence could be made equally certain, there would be good reason for including them in the same provision. In this manner, would pretty decisive evidence be obtained of the comparative prevalence of good conduct in the different parishes, and a motive of some importance would be applied to the obtaining of it.
We think that infinite advantage might be derived from the day of rest, if real Christian consideration, exempt from all superstitious feelings, by which the clergy have hitherto converted it to their own use, were applied to it.
We think it of great importance, that all the families of a parish should be got to assemble on the Sunday—clean, and so dressed, as to make a favourable appearance in the eyes of one another. This alone is ameliorating.
An address delivered to these assembled neighbours, by their common friend and benefactor, on their means of lessening the evils, and ensuring the happiness of one another, the Edition: current; Page: [290] motives they have to this conduct, its harmony with the laws of that benevolent Being of whom our lives are the gift, and who has made the connexion between our own happiness and the aid we afford to the happiness of others inseparable—would come powerfully in aid of all the other means employed to make salutary impressions on their minds.
When the parishioners are assembled, it is of importance to consider in what other ways the meeting can be turned to advantage.
One thing is very obvious: the opportunity would be favourable of doing something to add to their education. As often as the means were available, useful lectures on various branches of art and science might be delivered to them. Of what importance would it be to the numerous classes of workmen who make use of tools, to be made acquainted, in a general way, with the mechanical powers? What interest might be excited by chemical experiments; and what benefit derived from the knowledge of the composition and decomposition of bodies, which that science imparts. The science of botany, to all those whose employment is in the fields, and to the females whose monotonous lives are confined to their cottages, would afford a great source of interest and delight. Why should not even the wonders of the distant world—the magnitude and laws of the celestial bodies, be laid open to their minds? It will not be disputed that lectures on the art of preserving the health, pointing out the mistakes which ignorant people commit in the physical management, both of themselves and their children, and both the preventive and curative means which they might employ, would be of infinite importance to them.
It is impossible to estimate too highly the benefit which would be derived from good lectures to those parochial assemblies on the education of their children: not merely in sending them to school, and getting them taught to read and write, but in moulding their tempers; in making them gentle, moderate, forbearing, kind, and deeply impressed with the importance to themselves of habits of industry and frugality.
Not merely the mode of conducting themselves towards their children—the mode of conducting themselves towards their servants is an important topic. On the right and the wrong in this matter, in which the grossest errors are habitually committed, good teaching would be of the greatest utility. Even in the mode of training and conducting their beasts, there is great good to be done by proper instruction—in order to habituate them to the thought that gentleness is more effectual than cruelty—that when the animal disappoints our expectation, Edition: current; Page: [291] it is not by design, but by its not knowing what we desire, and that beating it for it knows not what, is no means of correction to the animal, but fuel to one of the worst of our own distempers—the disposition to inflict evil upon whatsoever or whosoever is the cause of immediate annoyance to ourselves. No man practises ferocity towards animals who would not, with a little more temptation, practise it towards his fellow-men; and this is a propensity which may be effectually rooted out.
There are even branches of political science, in which it would be of importance that the people should receive instruction in their weekly assemblies. They cannot, for example, be too completely made to understand the laws which determine the rate of wages—from ignorance of which rise most of their contentions with their masters, as well as the other evils which they endure. Indeed, a knowledge of the laws of nature, by operation of which the annual produce of the labour of the community is distributed, is the best of all modes of reconciling them to that inequality of distribution which they see takes place, and which there are people ignorant or wicked enough to tell them, is all in violation of their rights, because it is by their labour that everything is produced.
We go farther: we say there is no branch of political knowledge which ought not to be carefully taught to the people in their parochial assemblies on the day of rest. If it be an established maxim of reason, that there is no security for the good use of the powers of government, but through the check imposed upon it by the representatives of the people, and no security that the representatives will duly apply that check, unless the people make them, by a right use of the power of choosing and dismissing them, it is evident how necessary a condition of good government it is that political knowledge should be diffused among the people.
And the elements of the politics are not abstruse. There is nothing in them above the comprehension of a sensible man of the most numerous class. They relate to nothing but the common-sense means for the attainment of a common-sense object—the means of compelling those in whose hands the powers of government are placed, to make the best use of them. Questions, no doubt, arise in the exercise of those powers, which are exceedingly difficult, and require the highest measure of knowledge and understanding rightly to determine them: the question of war for example. The decision whether the known calamities of war, or the evils threatened by the unchecked proceedings of another state, are, in any instance, the greatest, may require the most extensive range of knowledge, Edition: current; Page: [292] and the utmost skill and sagacity in placing the exact value on the causes of future events.
Even the elements of jurisprudence might be taught to the people with great advantage in their Sunday meetings. The art and science of protection might be opened up to them in a manner which they would find in the highest degree interesting. How usefully might they be made to perceive that to them, above all others, it is the most necessary? The rich man can always do a great deal for his own protection. The poor man—unless the means of many, combined with art, are applied to protect him—is totally deprived of it. The institution of laws and tribunals is that combination; and the essence of them it is not difficult to unfold. To protect a man in the use of what is his own, the means must be provided of determining what is his own—that is, a civil code must be constructed. To prevent violations of what the law has declared to be a man’s own—that is, declared to be his rights—the law must determine what acts shall be considered violations of them, and what penalty shall be annexed to each: that is, a criminal code must be made. This is all plain; and the development of it would convey, even to the common people, the most useful ideas.
The necessity of a third party, to settle disputes, and afford redress of wrongs, is a maxim of common sense, familiar to all. This is the establishment of courts of justice; and the discussion of that subject is merely the inquiry, by the instrumentality of what means can the settlement of questions of right, and the redress of wrongs, be most effectually and cheaply accomplished. Not only is there nothing abstruse in this developement—it is a subject, the discussion of which, as coming home to their businesses and bosoms, is calculated to excite the most lively interest, and exceedingly to improve their minds.
So much, then, for the serious matters with which the minds of the people might be usefully engaged in their parochial meetings on the day of rest. But further than this, it is well known to those who have made the principles of human nature their study, that few things tend more effectually to make impressions on the minds of men, favourable to kindness, to generosity, to feeling joy with the joys, sorrow with the sorrows of others; from which the disposition to mutual helpfulness mainly proceeds,—than their being habituated to rejoice together—to partake of pleasures in common. Upon this principle it is that the amusements of the common people are looked upon by philosophical minds as a matter of grave importance. We think that social amusements, of which the tendency would be ameliorating Edition: current; Page: [293] with respect to the people, might be invented for the parochial meetings. They should be of a gentle character; harmonizing rather with the moderate, than the violent emotions; promoting cheerfulness, not profuse merriment. We think that sports, requiring great bodily exertion, and in which bodily strength is mainly displayed, are not well adapted to the day of rest, nor favourable to the feelings of brotherly love, to which the occupations of that day should be mainly subservient. The people of antiquity, who most encouraged sports of that description, did so with a view to war, to the evils of which they were almost incessantly exposed. We can enter but a very little way into the details of this subject. When the time shall come for thinking of it seriously, it will deserve a very careful and minute consideration.
Music and dancing, if regulated, as we think they might be, would afford an important resource. Dancing is a mimetic art, and might be so contrived as to represent all the social affections, which we most desire to implant in the breasts of the people, and to call up the trains of ideas by which they are nourished. A dance might be invented which would represent, as far as gestures and movements afford the means, the parental and filial affections; another, the fraternal affections; another, the sorrowing with those that sorrow, and rejoicing with those that rejoice. There is not any affection in itself more virtuous than that which exists between two unspotted persons of different sex, looking forward to the happiness of wedded life. But dances to represent that affection would be so apt to slide into lasciviousness, that we should be afraid to trust them. Dancing, as generally practised at present, is either a representation of profuse merriment, or of lasciviousness. In both shapes, it is altogether unfit for the moral and tranquil amusements of the day of rest. The dances which would harmonize with the tone of mind we desire to engender by everything which is done or witnessed on that day, would consist of the quiet and gentle motions, and would rather be an exhibition of grace, than of agility and strength.
The smallest tendency to exceed the bounds of decency and order in these amusements would be easily checked by a very simple expedient. The parishioners would select among themselves one of the most discreet of the elders, and one of the most discreet of the matrons, to be from time to time the master and mistress of the ceremonies, whom they would authorize to preserve regularity, and whose decisions they would firmly support.
In all ages and nations of the world, the taking of the Edition: current; Page: [294] meals together, or separately, has been considered a matter of importance. The conjunct meal has always been found a promoter of union; wherever, on the other hand, for some accursed cause, the object has been to separate men from one another, the eating and drinking together has been as carefully prevented. The institution of castes is mainly upheld by the strict separation of meals; and wherever anything partaking of the nature of the institution of castes is found to exist, as between the noble and plebeian in modern Europe, the separation in eating and drinking is more or less strictly attended to.
We are sure it would be a thing attended with the happiest effects, if the proper regulations could be enforced, that the people at their Sunday assemblings should partake of meals together, in greater or smaller parties, as convenience might direct. This would be a renewal of the social meals of the early Christians, for which the Greek language afforded an appropriate name. They were called Agapai: that is, friendship-meals. When the Christians of any particular place assembled to hear the instruction of an Apostle, or other teacher, it was their custom to carry with them something to eat and drink; of which they partook in common when the business of instruction was over; and thereby bound themselves to one another in stronger ties of affection.
The circumstance unfavourable to this practice in modern manners, is the prevalence of the taste for intoxicating liquors, in which there would be always some who would indulge to excess. This would produce disorder, and a spectacle far from favourable to the class of impressions which it should be the object of all the occupations of the day of rest to produce.
If there were not means by which this consequence could be prevented—and we suspect there are none but the total interdiction of intoxicating liquors—we believe it would be necessary to forego the advantages of the social meal. However, we see no reason to despair, especially under the influence of such a truly Christian pastor as we have been all along supposing, that the parishoners would come to an agreement among themselves to abstain at these meals from the use of intoxicating liquors, and not to permit any one to infringe the rule. They would have the resource of tea and coffee; and the example of the happiness of the Sunday meal would operate powerfully in weaning from the attachment to intoxicating liquors even those by whom it had been acquired.
We shall speedily hear an objector saying, ‘All very fine! But how to be done? In what parish are the people to be found, who will submit to all this moral drilling?’ The misfortune Edition: current; Page: [295] is, that such talk proceeds from objectors, who care not whether the work be done or not done; but they thus exempt themselves at small cost from the trouble of bearing a hand in it. However, if there were as many people in earnest about religion, as there are who pretend to be; if there were as many imbued and animated with the spirit of true religion, as there are besotted with dogmas and ceremonies, all the difficulties which present themselves would be overcome. Have not those who were interested in the work got men to submit to whatever was most repugnant to their nature and feelings? to fall in love with propositions incredible? to practise tiresome, and endless, and often painful tricks, in supposed service of the Deity, which sink the performers of them to the level of monkeys? And can we despair, if similar pains were taken, of getting them to do what, at every step, would be delightful, and from which they would derive the greatest of all conceivable pleasures, the consciousness, the heart-felt assurance, of rising higher and higher in the scale of virtue and intelligence every day! Assuredly, the best means of carrying on the moral culture of the people will not speedily present themselves to the people, if they are not aided; and if the influence of those whom they are always ready to follow is not employed to put them in the right path, and urge them forward in it to a certain extent. But for the accomplishment of all this, we should rely much on the efforts of such a class of parochial ministers as we have just been describing; who might be truly styled the servants of God, and the friends of man; who would do much, by their own influence, and much, by stimulating men of station and wealth to employ their influence in the same beneficent direction.
P. Q.

Edition: current; Page: [1]

Art. I.: LAW REFORM.
WE are relieved from a part of the labour which, a few years ago, would have been imposed upon us; it being no longer necessary to prove that we have occasion for law reform.
Of the signs of the times—now speaking a language very plain and impressive—this is one. A few years only have gone over our heads, since any imputation of imperfection in the law was resented as a crime against the state; when the unlimited praises of it, vented by generations of lawyers, one after another, for good reasons of their own, were received as implicitly as the axioms of geometry; and he who but sought to moderate the fury of panegyric was deemed the same kind of monster, as he who should have asserted that republicanism has its advantages.
The change has been so great, that now the extreme badness of the law is matter of universal admission; and wonder at the long-suffering stupidity of a people who submitted to such a nuisance is the sentiment bursting from every man’s lips. What is now therefore wanted is, instruction on the nature of the reforms we ought to have.
The ideas which are predominant on this subject are to the last degree defective. They spring from a narrow, mechanical view of the subject.
The present law-contrivances are a set of means for attaining the ends of law. It is acknowledged that they are ill adapted to that attainment. But men who look at the subject, without having studied the principles of it, can only look at the existing contrivances. They see defects and ill-working parts here and there in the machinery; and they are willing to try such changes upon those parts as they think will make them work better. They do not, however, take a full view of the subject. Their mental preparation does not fit them for that. They do not see, nor do they consider, the putting together of the whole. Powers must be put in action for the attainment of any end which is not spontaneous,—that of law in the same way as other Edition: current; Page: [2] ends. But it is evident that a combination of powers for the attainment of an end will work well or ill according to the mode of the combination. It is not enough that all the requisite powers are there; they must be so combined as to co-operate without obstruction, and with the greatest effect, to the attainment of that which is the object of their combination. A machine which is vicious in its original construction may be patched and patched to the end of time; and nothing but a blundering, ill-working instrument will, after all, be produced.
It is with a view to aid in removing the weakness of which we speak in the public mind, that the present article has been undertaken. We wish to give a specimen, however imperfect, of the mode of looking at the parts of a combination of means for attaining the ends of law, in the connexion they have with one another, and their common subserviency to the common end.
The meaning of the word Law (a word of too many acceptations), in the phrase “Reform of the Law,” is fixed, by usage, with considerable precision. It means the rules according to which the tribunals determine questions about rights, and punish the violation of them. The business of the tribunals is thus, in one word—protection; and that which they are appointed to protect, is rights.
As things are managed in England, that protection—upon which we observe, by the by, that all the happiness of society depends—is most imperfectly afforded. Under the pretence of affording it, other ends, and those directly opposed to it, have been most successfully pursued. This is now seen. And the inquiry therefore comes.—In what way is the remedy to be applied?
Towards the solution of that question, the first thing undoubtedly is, to determine what are the requisites of that protection,—what are the conditions essential to its existence. This is no very abstruse inquiry. In fact, all the inquiries of jurisprudence are of a very simple nature. They only seek to discover the common-sense road to a common-sense end.
It is easy to see that the first thing requisite for the protection of rights is, that they shall be known: if they are unknown, protection cannot be afforded; and, in proportion as they are imperfectly known, the protection of them must be imperfect.
Rights are constituted by the supreme power of the state. Nothing is, properly speaking, a right, but that which the supreme power wills to be a right; and to which, more or less perfectly, it yields protection.
Edition: current; Page: [3]
There are two ways in which this will of the supreme power is made known; either by express declaration in words; or by habitual acquiescence in what has grown up among the people themselves. Both modes exist in England. When the will of the supreme power is made known by words, we call the law statute law; when it is by acquiescence in custom, it is called common, or customary law. The greater part of the law of England is still in this last barbarous state.
In all countries, which are not pretty far advanced in civilization, there is no law but custom. The will of the supreme power with regard to rights is not expressed in words at all. It is only expressed by its acquiescence in the existing customs, and the enforcement which, with more or less regularity, it affords to them. This, for example, is the state of law in our widely-extended dominions in India; and now, for the first time, has the British legislature wisely given order that this most imperfect expression of the will of the supreme power shall be exchanged for the more perfect expression by words.
Where custom, acquiesced in, is the only law, the custom itself has often need to be proved. The judge takes evidence of it in the same way as of any other fact, and admits all the same media of proof. English law pursues a course of its own in this respect. It admits nothing as evidence of a custom of this kind (allowing for exceptions, of which there are some), but the decisions of the judges. In such a country as India, there are no recorded decisions of the judges, and this medium of proof is inaccessible; the judges, therefore, are left to the plain business of taking evidence in the plain and ordinary way. What a fabric of mysterious science—if the word science may be desecrated by using it in so unholy a combination—English lawyers have erected upon this ground, is sufficiently known. The question is often propounded, what this law, called common law, is; and nobody has yet given a satisfactory answer. Mr. Bentham affirmed that it is a non-entity,—a fiction set up, on each occasion, by the judge, to which he gives the effect of law; that is, he makes a law for each particular occasion; for which reason Mr. Bentham called it also judge-made law, and ex post facto law.
English lawyers have been very much at a loss to give an intelligible account of what it is they do on those occasions. They abjure the thought of making a law. The judges (that is their language) declare the law,—do not make it. But it is a curious case of declaring. To declare a law, it must exist; the common law, however, exists nowhere. Decisions of judges exist, but they are on particular cases, and Edition: current; Page: [4] are not laws*. When a new case occurs, that is, a case to which no decided cases very similar can be found, the lawyers look out for such as come the nearest to it, and then they decide by what they call analogy; which means, similitude of proportion, or of reason. They suppose a reason as the ground of the decision in the decided case, and they determine that the reason applies to the case in hand.
This is law in a very unsatisfactory state. What shall be a man’s right, does not in such circumstances depend upon the will of the legislature expressed in a general rule, but upon the individual will of the judge, applied to an individual case. Reason tends always to take law out of this state. It is not safe to allow the judge any power over the law†; his business is, after investigation, to say under what class of cases, provided for by the legislature, the individual case which he has to deal with is included.
The real nature of the operation performed by the judge in a case of common law is mistaken by English lawyers universally, and utterly hidden from view by their language. For the ground of every decision at common law, it is assumed that there is a custom. Customary law without a custom is a contradiction in terms. To prove the existence of the custom, they adduce such decisions of the judges as would be supported by the custom if it existed; and they admit no other kind of evidence to establish its existence. It is very evident that a rule of action made out of such materials must be exceedingly imperfect. First of all, a custom is seldom anything very precise; the notion of it is almost always confused and unsteady, to a greater or less degree. In the next place, the decisions of judges are often not good evidence of a custom; the decision of a judge is only evidence that he inferred a custom: but whether properly or improperly remains to be inquired. Again, it often happens that there are conflicting decisions. Next, the cases upon which any decision has been passed may, nono of them, have more than a faint similitude to the case which stands for the decision of the judge, or indicate precisely any custom within which it can be said to fall. The judge, however, pursues his course; a custom he resolves there shall be. He calls it a law. It is a law in a dormant, alias nonexistent, state. He supposes, therefore, such a law as he pleases, and thereupon decides.

Besides the obvious and enormous imperfections of a rule of action which is only a custom, the other portion of our law, expressed in the words of the legislature, is in a most deplorable state. It has been made upon no plan. The parts of it have been produced upon the spur of the occasion. Each enactment has been squared to the present emergency; and thus, frequently, we have enactment upon enactment, to any amount, upon parts of a subject, which might all have been included, and much better included, in one. Besides this total want of order and method in our law-book, the style in which the laws are written is the worst possible; it is loaded with useless words, to a degree which would be utterly ridiculous, if custom, and the reverence due to the subject, did not repress the natural emotion. This faulty expression is very often the cause of ambiguity and uncertainty, and obscures the meaning to all but those who have been called upon to make a study of it. A consequence of this unskilled and rude composition is, that the volume of the law is swelled to so enormous a size, that a complete knowledge of it is the next thing to impossible; and the mass of the people are placed in helpless dependence on the class of lawyers to whom the knowledge is by that means confined. As our thinking countrymen are so much more accustomed and willing to be guided by authority than by reason, we shall here give them a delineation of our law, by a man who had quite propensity enough to over-praise it, and was very seldom restrained from using his lavish hand,—we mean, the famous Lord Erskine.

‘I expressed to my learned conductor the strongest desire to see the Book in which their decisions and statutes were compiled and registered for public instruction and the administration of justice.—He smiled very significantly, saying he would carry me to where my curiosity should be indulged, and, in a few minutes afterwards, we arrived at a house, from whence I expected to carry home under my arm the volume I had been promised:—it was one of the great libraries of the country, being the property of a nobleman, in whose family books had been accumulating for centuries, and who preserved them in the utmost regularity and order.
We were shown into a spacious apartment, handsomely fitted up and provided with ladders, such as are common in England, for reaching their highest orders. I was greatly struck with the immense number of volumes, in the view of which, however, my learned conductor interrupted me, by saying, that, as our time was limited, we must not waste it in one part of the library, as it was divided into different chambers, in which the books were classed according to their subjects. I was surprised at this, and told him, that though England was more famous for literature of every character and description than Edition: current; Page: [6] any nation of our world, yet I had conceived the hall we were leaving contained the whole collection. “The whole collection!” he re-echoed with the utmost seeming amazement—“why, my dear stranger, they are only his Law-books.” “What do you mean?” I answered, with equal surprise on my part, as the reader may well believe—“what law-books? Have you communications then with the planets and fixed stars, and made a digest of all their institutions?” “Oh, no,” he said, “they are only books of very local jurisdiction—they are our own laws only.—Those on your right hand,” pointing as far as we could see, “are our decisions—and those on your left are our statutes.” I stood silent for a while, and then broke out with an astonishment I could not conceal—“If this he really so, how are your people to know by what rules they are to govern themselves, what duties they are to perform, or how to avoid the penalties annexed to disobedience?” “Nothing so easy,” replied my learned conductor; “nothing in either of our worlds so perfectly plain and simple,” laying his hand, at the same time, on what seemed to correspond with some of the indexes in our own books—“what shall I find for you?—I will turn to it in a second.”—“Turn then,” I said, “to your law for preventing infection from the plague”—for I had been told they had regulations for quarantine. “Here it is,” said the Armatan counsellor, as he read the title; but he had not proceeded ten lines in the enacting part, when we found it principally related to the smuggling of chew-chum, a leaf resembling our tobacco. “Oh,” said he, on my laughing at the discordancy, “this is a mere mistake, depend upon it, some misprinting—let me turn to another.” “Well then,” I said, “find me the law which regulates your marriages;” which he turned up accordingly in a moment, and read its title with an air of triumph; but he had not read far, when we found it mostly related to horned cattle—he was now rather disconcerted, when I laughed, and said to him, “Oh, this can only be a misprinting—try something else—let me see the act which regulates the functions of your bishops and clergy.” “That I can do,” he replied; “it is now,” he said, “before you,” as he read the title; but there was little in the body of it, except as to passing women with child of bastards, to their proper parishes, as we at least should call them. It was now my turn to triumph, and I could not help exclaiming, “You have found it at last, have you?—your women, I hope, don’t swear their bastards to your bishops and clergy? I will now positively give you but one chance more, and you must find me at once something consistent, or I will go back again to England, and send over Lord Stanhope to thump you.”—Alas! I little thought how soon he was to be lost to ourselves!
He now turned, by my desire, and as his last effort, to an act against bribery and corruption, the title of which he was not long in finding, but so little was the concordance of the enactment, that, on the contrary, it only continued and secured the constitutions of their rotten boroughs.
“As he went on, referring to the decisions of their courts, he was frequently in the same manner most sorely puzzled.—Sometimes he found a case settled, and told me it was undoubted law; but on looking farther, he often informed me that it had been afterwards settled the Edition: current; Page: [7] other way, and in a subsequent volume, which he turned to, he frequently discovered that the last decision was clogged with exceptions which supported neither; but that, by still looking onward, he could show me how it was settled at last;—he accordingly found some of his cases, but they had many times stood over for another argument, and had never been decided.
In this way he went on, until he was driven in the end to admit that if a young man were to begin to read all the books of their laws, written and unwritten, public and private, on his first entering their courts, he would be superannuated before he got through them.’

—Armata, Part II., p. 135—140.


As a deep conviction of the weight of the grievance, of which we crave the redress, is the first step in order to its attainment, we shall produce another account of it, though forming a longer quotation than we could have wished, given by a lawyer of great authority—the late Sir Samuel Romilly.

‘In spite of the panegyrics which have been so often pronounced upon our laws, and upon the administration of them, no person who is practically acquainted with our English system of jurisprudence, and who will speak of it ingenuously, can deny that it is attended with great and numerous mischiefs, which are every day becoming more intolerable. The difficulties, the expense, the tedious length of litigations, the uncertainty of their issue, and, in many cases, the lamentable delay of decision, are but too well known to the great number to whom all this is a source of profit, and to the far greater number on whom it brings down calamity and ruin. What are the causes of these evils it would be rash in any one to pronounce, before he had fully and anxiously examined every part of the subject. They are evils, however, of such magnitude, that every discussion which affords a chance of leading us to the discovery of their causes, and consequently to the providing against them an effectual remedy, must be regarded as highly beneficial. Considered in this point of view, the question, whether the common, or unwritten law, be better calculated than a written code, to provide effectually for the security of men’s persons and properties, in a state as far advanced as England is in civilization and refinement, is one of very great public interest; and we shall therefore make no apology for proceeding to the discussion of it, or for mixing arguments of our own with those, which either we have found in the work before us, or have been suggested by its perusal.
The first step to be taken in this inquiry is to ascertain the nature of the unwritten law, by which England is at this moment governed. We are not then to understand that the rules by which property is to be distributed, and the conduct of men to be regulated, really exist only in oral tradition, and the imperfect recollections of individuals. What is called with us unwritten law is in truth to be collected from a great number of written records and printed volumes; and, according to old Fortescue and to Blackstone, it is only by a twenty years’ study of them that a perfect knowledge of it can be gained. It is by reading, and by Edition: current; Page: [8] reading only, that the lex non scripta, as well as the statute law, is to be acquired; but, in the one case, we find the law expressing its commands in direct and positive terms—while, in the other, we can arrive at a knowledge of it only through its interpreters and oracles—the judges.
The common law is to be collected, not from the plain text of a comprehensive ordinance, which is open to all men to consult, but from the decisions of courts of justice, pronounced in a great variety of cases, and which have disclosed small portions of it from time to time, just as the miscellaneous transactions of men in a state of society may have chanced to require, or give occasion for its promulgation.
Of a law so constituted, it must necessarily happen that a large portion must always remain unpublished. The occasion for declaring it never having occurred, it must rest (as all that is now published once did) in a latent state, till some event happens to call it into use and into notice. Of a statute law, we know with certainty the whole extent,—and we can at once discern what it has not, as well as what it has provided; but under the common law there is no case unprovided for,—though there may be many of which it is extremely difficult, and indeed impossible, to say beforehand what the provision is. For the cases on which no decision has yet been pronounced, an unknown law exists, which must be brought to light whenever the courts are called upon for their decision. For all practical purposes, a law so unknown is the same as a law not in existence; to declare, is substantially to enact it; and the judges, though called only expounders of law, are in reality legislators. Of what importance is it, that, by a legal fiction, the law is supposed to have had pre-existence, since, being unknown till it was promulgated by some tribunal, it was not possible that men could have conformed to it as the rule of their conduct?—and yet, in this very circumstance, have some most eminent lawyers discovered a superiority in the common law over all written statutes. Lord Mansfield, for example, when pleading as an advocate at the bar, is reported to have thus expressed himself:—“Cases of law depend upon occasions which give rise to them. All occasions do not arise at once. A statute very seldom can take in all cases; therefore the common law, that works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountains of justice, is superior to an act of Parliament.”
The law, thus unknown to others till it was promulgated in some decision, can hardly be said to have been previously known, even to the judges themselves. When some new question is brought before them to decide, those oracles of the law do not, like the oracles of old, (the supposed sources of all wisdom and knowledge,) immediately pronounce their authoritative and unerring responses; neither do they retire to their chambers, as if to consult some code of which they are the sole possessors, and then reveal in public, to the contending parties, the text which they have discovered. They profess themselves unqualified immediately to decide: they require to be themselves informed: it is necessary that they should hear, and compare, and examine, and reason, and be assisted by the arguments of others, before they are prepared to pronounce Edition: current; Page: [9] what the law has declared. They even call upon the litigant parties themselves to state by their advocates, what they conceive the law to be, and to support their statements by reasoning and authorities, and analogous decisions; and it sometimes happens that, even with all this assistance, the judges find themselves unable to declare what the law is, and require the assistance of a second argument, and by other counsel.
That all these deliberations, and this laborious process, should be necessary, will not appear surprising to those who reflect what is the nature of the operation to be performed, when we would discover what the common law is upon some point upon which it has never yet been declared. Dr. Paley calls it, and not unaptly, a competition of opposite analogies. “When a point of law,” he says, “has been once adjudged, neither that question, nor any which completely, and in all its circumstances, corresponds with that, can be brought a second time into dispute; but questions arise which resemble this only indirectly, and in part, and in certain views and circumstances, and which may seem to bear an equal, or a greater affinity, to other adjudged cases; questions which can be brought within any fixed rule only by analogy, and which hold an analogy by relation to different rules. It is by the urging of the different analogies that the contention of the bar is carried on; and it is in the comparison, adjustment, and reconciliation of them with one another, in the discerning of such distinctions, and in the framing of such a determination, as may either save the various rules alleged in the cause, or, if that be impossible, may give up the weaker analogy to the stronger, that the sagacity and wisdom of the court are seen and exercised.” The common law was covered with a veil of antiquity;—that veil has been, by the decisions of the judges, in part removed: what it is that still remains concealed from the public view no one can with certainty tell. Nothing is left us but to conjecture, and our conjectures are wholly founded upon those various analogies of which Paley speaks. The best supported of those analogies is that which generally prevails; it is acknowledged, from that moment, as the law of the land, and as a point from which other analogies may in future be drawn.
It is not a little amusing to hear what Blackstone (who is, upon almost all occasions, the apologist for what he finds established) says of this unwritten law:—“The moment,” these are his words, “that a decision has been pronounced, that which was before uncertain, and perhaps indifferent, becomes a permanent rule, which it is not in the breast of any subsequent judge to alter or vary from;” and he accordingly tells us, that “it is an established rule to abide by former precedents, where the same point comes again in litigation.” How, indeed, should it be otherwise? Where the authority of a written text cannot be referred to, it is from decisions alone that the law can be collected; and it should seem to be as necessary for those who administer the law to follow those decisions implicitly, as to obey the plain injunctions of a statute: and yet, according to Blackstone, “this rule admits of exception, where the former determination is most evidently contrary to reason, and much more, if it be clearly contrary to the Divine law.” Edition: current; Page: [10] Here are other sources, then, from which we are to collect the unwritten law—namely, the dictates of reason, and the declared will of God. But, unfortunately, the dictates of reason, which are at all times sufficiently uncertain as a positive rule of conduct, are rendered much more uncertain by the learned Commentator’s explanation. For, in many cases, he tells us—the reason of a law cannot be discovered by any sagacity, and yet must be presumed to exist; and he proceeds to lay it down, as a maxim of English jurisprudence, that it is only where a precedent, or the rule which it has established, is flatly absurd or unjust, that its authority may be disregarded. The Cambridge professor, who has commented upon the Commentaries, controverts even this position, and most satisfactorily proves, that absolute demonstration of the absurdity and injustice of a rule, is not alone sufficient, at the common law, to detract from its binding force. By the law of England, till the Legislature interposed to alter it, every statute had a retrospective operation to the first day of the Sessions in which it passed; and acts, therefore, which were done after the Sessions had commenced, and before the law was made, fell under the animadversion of its ex post facto enactments, and subjected the author of them to the penalty of having disregarded prohibitions which had no existence. A stronger instance to prove that absurdity and injustice are not incompatible with a rule of the common law, could not have been adduced.
This source of uncertainty becomes the more formidable, from the consideration that the judges are themselves to determine, whether the former decision was or was not contrary to reason; or, in other words, whether it shall or shall not be binding on them. It must always, therefore, be in the power of the judge, notwithstanding the oath which we are told he takes, “to determine, not according to his own private judgment, but according to the known laws and customs of the land.” To relieve himself from embarrassing precedents which may be cited, he has only to declare, that those precedents are contrary to reason, and were therefore themselves deviations from the common law, and to profess, in the language of Mr. Justice Blackstone, that he is “not making a new law, but vindicating the old from misrepresentation.” This doctrine, that former determinations are of authority only as they are consistent with reason, affords, in the opinion of the same writer, good ground for those high-strained panegyrics of the law which are so often pronounced by our judges. “Hence,” to use his own words, “it is that our lawyers with justice tell us, that the law is the perfection of reason, and that what is not reason is not law.” An aphorism which is, however, involved in such a cloud of mystery, that we are at the same time told, that not even the judges can, upon all occasions, discover in what that reason, the test of genuine law, consists; and that they are bound to hold everything which they find decided by their predecessors to be law, and consequently the perfection of reason, unless it be “flatly absurd or unjust.” In contemplation of law, there is no medium, it seems, between the perfection of reason and gross absurdity.
Not to deceive ourselves, however, we ought to understand, that this Edition: current; Page: [11] supposed bringing to light of the ancient law, which had been for ages unrevealed, is at best but a fiction. The law so declared in many cases had no existence till the declaration was made, although the judges do not “pretend to make new law,” but “to vindicate the old from misrepresentation.” It has already been observed, that where the whole law is embodied in written statutes, cases may occur on which the law is silent; but where an unwritten law prevails, this can never happen. That the law is not already declared is only because the particular occasion for declaring it never before occurred. The judges being unable, therefore, to predicate of any case that it is one which the law has not foreseen, are under the necessity, with the aid of Dr. Paley’s Analogies, of supplying what is wanting, and of discovering the ancient law which is supposed to have been once expressed in statutes that have long since mouldered away, or to have been pronounced in judgments of which no record has been preserved. In name, this differs from making laws,—but it is only in name. Whether the chasm has been made by the ravages of time, or was left in the original fabric of our law, it is precisely by the same process that it must be filled up. The same recourse must be had to Paley’s Analogies, whether the object of the judges be to conjecture what the lost law must have been, or to make a new law, which will best quadrate and harmonize with the relics of the old*.”

Sir Samuel goes on, at some length, exposing the defects of this species of law, and then adds:—

‘Such are among the principal objections to this species of legislation. But it is to be observed that, while this is going on, there is amongst us a legislation of another kind, proceeding with equal activity—that of the avowed and acknowledged legislature, which every year sends into the world a cumbrous Collection of new Statutes. Between these two legislatures there is no unity of design; their works are as unlike as the characters of the authors and their modes of legislation. Of a law, proceeding from such sources, it is not surprising that it is found to be uncertain, intricate, obscure, perplexed, inconsistent, full of refinement and subtlety, and subject to continual fluctuations. The law which is every term discovered and brought to light by the judges, seems to vic in extent with that which is made by the Parliament; and the lawyer’s library is every year enlarged by one bulky volume of statutes, and by several volumes of reported decisions. The new statutes of each year are swollen out to a bulk surpassing that of the year which preceded it; and every fresh term seems to be prolific of more judicial reports than the term that went before it. So considerable are the changes and augmentations which are thus continually taking place in English law, that the treatises, essays, and compilations, which have been composed on various legal subjects, require to be from time to time renewed, that they may not mislead those who consult them; and, upon many heads, an old law treatise is of as little use as an almanack for a year that has expired. The duties of a justice of the peace were formerly comprised Edition: current; Page: [12] in one small duodecimo volume; they are now to be searched for in five large octavos, containing altogether 4400 pages. To this size “Burn’s Justice” has been gradually expanded, in the course of the twenty-two editions which, during a period of sixty years, it has passed through. So many new reports have been printed, and so many new statutes made, that, as the publisher tells us in the advertisement to the fifteenth edition, “every new edition, in order to keep pace with the law, is in effect a new book.” ’

—p. 223.


We do not suppose that another word is necessary to be said, in order to show the necessity of having our law better expressed. This is one of the strongest of all the dictates of common sense. If anything requires to be well expressed, it is the law. If anything requires to be laid down, orderly, clearly, unambiguously, succinctly, it is the law—upon which depends the security of everything which we enjoy.*
It is necessary here to obviate a blunder, or a misrepresentation, which, though very stupid, is very common. When we speak of expressing the law better, we mean nothing else. We mean not to alter the law in a tittle. We mean to improve the expression—to make that clear, which is now obscure—that distinct, which is now ambiguous—that orderly, which is now a mass of disorder—that succinct, which is now prolix, to a degree altogether intolerable—and that easy to be known, which is now almost beyond comprehension.
But men have gotten it into their heads, that to make a code is to make new laws—that to make a code, the existing laws are to be swept away, and a new set put in their place. With that belief, they have a horror of codification; and if they were right in the belief, we should most assuredly join with them in the horror. This would be tantamount to a scheme of universal confiscation. It would be to begin by destroying all rights, that Edition: current; Page: [13] we might proceed to establish others; a project so pregnant with human misery, that the most frightful of tyrants, in their maddest fits, never conceived anything which approached it.
Rights are not touched by codification. Rights, which are now ill expressed, will, by codification, be well expressed; and that is the whole matter. Every man’s right is then a better thing for him than it was before. The protection of it, which is that alone which gives it value, is better provided for. The good expression of rights is the first of the conditions on which perfect protection of them comes within the verge of possibility.
Another thing with which men frighten themselves, in regard to this great service due to the community, is its difficulty. They tell us that they see the importance of codification: but how, they cry, is it to be done?—How is it to be done!—Why, by working at it, to be sure. Is anything else done but by being worked at? And what right have we to talk of difficulties till we have tried to overcome them? Many things which appear great difficulties at a distance are found of tolerably easy management when we approach them: so it will be found with codification. Good God! cannot we write the law over again? And have we not men among us who can marshal disordered ideas, and put every one of them in its proper place, with its proper expression?—That is all. The subject is large, and the work is therefore extensive: it is difficult in that sense, because there is a great deal to be done—because it must be done with accuracy, and accurate work is slow. But what other difficulty is there, if the proper men are applied to the task?
Having said thus much on the first of the requisites of law reform—the perfecting of the text of the law—we have only to proceed to the instruments by means of which the law is secured of its effects. The law; and its instruments;—these are the two subjects, and the only two, which enter into the consideration of him whose desire it is that the ends of law should be attained.
The first of the instruments of law is the judge. When there is any question about a right, or the violation of a right, a third party must be called to decide—as few men are fair judges when the case is their own. Our next inquiry therefore is, in what manner judges can be employed with most advantage for the attainment of the ends of law—in other words, the protection of rights.
Every step in this inquiry is so obvious and certain, that we may expect acquiescence in each proposition on the very first announcement.
In the first place, it is clear that you must have judges sufficient in number to decide all the questions which arise. It is Edition: current; Page: [14] not less clear, that they ought to be distributed in such a manner as best to suit the convenience of those who have occasion for their intervention—that is, to be so located, that the suitors may have the smallest distance to go, in order to obtain the service which they require. It is the clear dictate then of reason, that there ought to be a judge in every district of a convenient size: that convenience depending mainly on three things—the amount of the population, the facility of access, and the means of the community to bear the expense.
It is not less clearly the dictate of reason, that each local judge should perform the whole of the judicial business of the district. The convenience secured by this is most material. It is obviously important, that each judge should have as much to do as he can well perform; that all unnecessary expense may be avoided. In the next place, the advantage is great of having the district small to which his services are allotted, that he may be easy of access. These advantages are combined, by giving to one man the whole of the judicial business of every kind. Suppose you were to divide the business between two: if you give the men full employment, you must have the district twice as large as it would otherwise need to be, and the difficulty of access on the part of the suitor twice as great, without any advantage whatever; whether you take for the principle of your division suits classed according to the amount of the property in litigation, or any other distinction.
This being determined, we see clearly what comes next for consideration. Having a judge in every district who performs the whole of the judicial business of the district, we should have done enough, as far as judges are concerned, if we were certain that those judges would all do their duty. We are, however, certain of the contrary; we must, therefore, have the means of correcting their errors, whether the effect of weakness, negligence, or corruption. The suitors must have justice. If a suitor is dissatisfied with the decision which has been passed in his case, there ought to be somebody else to whom he can apply for a revisal of the decision: that is to say, there ought to be a judge of appeal. This is found by experience, and is easily seen by reason, to be the grand security against misdecision. We are then to investigate the means by which courts of appeal may be made to yield us this security with greatest advantage.
In this, as in most of the things which are to be done for the correct administration of law, the simplest expedient is the best. When the proceeding of the original judge is revised by a revising judge, the object is accomplished.
It has been made a question—whether, when you have obtained Edition: current; Page: [15] one revisal, you ought not, for greater security, to have a second? namely, a revisal of the revisal.
The minds of the men who are entitled to have an opinion on this subject seem to be made up. It is generally allowed that there ought to be but one stage of appeal. This is placed beyond controversy, when it is considered that you add nothing to your security for right decision by adding to the number of appeals. You can have no greater reason for trusting to a second revisal than to the first—to a third than to the second, and so on. With each of these appeals, however, you have the mischief of delay and expense, without any the smallest advantage.
A question here occurs which applies to judges of both kinds, both the original judge and the judge in appeal. The question is—whether there ought to be one judge for one question, or whether each question ought to be decided by more judges than one?
Common sense appears to be perfectly equal to the solution of this question. If your judge is a competent man, he can decide the question properly without any assistance. Then why give him that of which he has no need? By this you multiply expense, and secure not any concomitant advantage. If you add incompetent men to the competent one, you only embarrass his proceedings, and delay or perhaps disfigure the decision. If you add other competent men, you do what is unnecessary—you increase your expense, and lose the inestimable advantages of prompt decision and of concentrated responsibility.
There ought clearly, then, to be one judge for one question, whether it be the original question or the appellate one: that is, in other words, each tribunal, whether a tribunal of original jurisdiction, or a tribunal of appellate jurisdiction, ought to consist of one judge.
Thus, all the questions which regard the establishment of judges are solved. There ought to be two sets of tribunals, one for the original jurisdiction, and one for appellate jurisdiction. These tribunals ought to be sufficiently numerous to do the judicial business of the country without delay; and the tribunals of original jurisdiction ought to be so located as to suit, in the highest degree, the convenience of those who have occasion to apply to them.
The location of the appellate tribunals is to be determined by considering what is their proper business; or, in other word, what that is in which appellate jurisdiction properly consists.
This is a question of great importance; and it is one on Edition: current; Page: [16] which even those who speculate about law have not yet all attained very clear ideas.
We have already called it by its proper name—Revisal. It is the revisal of the proceedings of the original judge, upon a complaint of one of the suitors that a wrong decision has been pronounced. Misdecision always arises from one of three causes—either because the point, on which the question of right depends, has not been properly determined; because the evidence has not been duly and properly weighed; or because evidence which ought to have been taken has been omitted.
It is evident that the question on the first two points can be determined by inspection of the record, the written statement of the pleadings, and the written statement of the evidence. On the third point, the court of appeal decides either that all the evidence has been taken which ought to have been, or that it has not. If the former, the suit is determined; if the latter, it is the business of the appellate court to remit the cause to the original court, with an order to take the omitted evidence, and give its decision afresh.
It is of great importance to remark (for in conceiving the business of appellate judicature confusion of ideas has prevailed to a lamentable degree) that it is no part of the business of an appellate judicatory to take evidence. When evidence is taken by an appellate court, the cause is tried over again. Your court of appeal discharges the function not of a court of appeal, but a court of original jurisdiction; while the decision of the original court passes for nothing at all: it is so much lost time, lost labour, and lost expense.
This being settled, and it thus appearing that whatever has to be done by the court of appeal is to be grounded on what appears on the written record of the proceedings before the original judge, there is no such necessity for proximity to the suitors in the case of appeal courts, as in that of courts of original jurisdiction. The presence of parties and the presence of witnesses is essential in the original court; neither is necessary in the court of appeal. The written record of the proceedings of the original court may travel by post; and whether it travels ten miles or a hundred miles, is of no importance. The place where the best public is found—where the eye of intelligent spectators is likely to act with greatest efficiency, is the best situation for courts of appeal. That, generally speaking, is the metropolis; and, in England, there is no doubt about the matter. The distance in England of the metropolis from the most remote parts of the kingdom would produce little inconvenience in the business of appeal.
Edition: current; Page: [17]
The idea, then, of the reform to be aimed at in the constitution of our courts is sufficiently simple. We ought to have courts of original jurisdiction, at convenient distances, all over the country; and we ought to have judges of appeal in Westminster Hall. The number of the judges of appeal should, of course, be proportioned to the business to be done; each, in his own court, deciding individual questions alone; and all deliberating together when any point is to be determined whereon uniformity of decision may depend.
We do not enter into any argument to show the utility of this constitution of courts, because its perfect adaptation to the ends which all profess to have in view must inevitably be seen by every man who will take the trouble to apply his reason to the case. We deem it, however, of importance to give an idea of the dreadful state we are in with respect to courts, as matters are at present arranged, in the best governed country in the world; and it is fortunate that we can present a delineation of a great part of it by a master-hand.
Mr. (now Lord) Brougham, in his celebrated speech on Law Reform in the House of Commons, on the 7th Feb. 1828, said:

‘I invite you then, Sir, to enter upon an unsparing examination of this mighty subject; I invite the House to proceed with me, first of all, into the different courts—to mark what failures, in practice, are to be found in the system, as it was originally framed, as well as what errors time has engendered by occasioning a departure from that system; and afterwards to consider whether we may not, safely and usefully, apply to those defects remedies of a seasonable and temperate nature, restoring what is decayed, if it be good—lopping off what experience has proved to be pernicious.
I.—1. In the first place, let us proceed to the courts in Westminster Hall, and observe the course pursued in them. The House is aware that, whatever may have been the original of our three great common law courts, they now deal with nearly the same description of suits; and that, though the jurisdiction of each was at first separate, and confined within very narrow limits, their functions are now nearly the same. The jurisdiction of the Court of King’s Bench, for example, was originally confined to pleas of the crown, and then extended to actions where violence was used—actions of trespass by force; but, now, all actions are admissible within its walls, through the medium of a legal fiction, adopted for the purpose of enlarging its authority, that every person sued is in the custody of the marshal of the court, and may, therefore, be proceeded against for any personal cause of action. Thus, by degrees, this court has drawn over to itself actions, which really belong to the great forum of ordinary actions between subject and subject, as its name implies, the Court of Common Pleas. The Court of Common Pleas, however, in its exertions for extending its business, was not so fortunate as its rival: for, though it made a vigorous attempt, Edition: current; Page: [18] under Lord Chief Justice North, to enlarge its sphere, it never was able to obtain cognizance of the peculiar subject of King’s Bench jurisdiction—Crown Pleas.
The Exchequer has adopted a similar course; for, though it was originally confined to the trial of revenue cases, it has, by means of another fiction—the supposition that everybody sued is a debtor to the crown, and further that he cannot pay his debt because the other party will not pay him—opened its doors to every suitor, and so drawn to itself the right of trying cases that were never intended to be placed within its jurisdiction.
The first state of the courts being that of distinct jurisdiction, then of course this separation of provinces was praised; afterwards, all distinction became obsolete, and then the conflict and competition were as much commended; and with far greater reason if the competition were real; but it is almost purely speculative. In the first place, the Court of Common Pleas shuts its doors to many practitioners of the law, by requiring that a certain proportion of fees should be advanced at a much earlier stage in the cause than is customary in the other courts. For who is it that must advance this money? Either the attorney himself, if it be his own cause, must pay the money out of his own pocket, or, if he is acting as agent for a country practitioner, he must begin by laying out the money long before he can draw upon his employer for reimbursement, and he is not, in all cases, sure of being repaid for those advances. In the second place, clients and their attornies are induced not to carry causes into the Common Pleas, by the strict monopoly that exists in the advocates of that court.
The Exchequer, in like manner, has its drawbacks, though they operate in another way. There is one reason why, as at present constituted, it cannot do much business, or have the high reputation which it ought to enjoy; I mean the mixture of various suits which are cognizable in it. It is, in fact, a court of all sorts—of equity and of law—of revenue law and of ordinary law—of law between subject and subject, as well as of law between the subject and the crown. This makes suitors, seeing the business done in so many different ways, come to the conclusion that it is not well done in any.
What, then, is the natural consequences of those restrictions which prevent suitors from approaching the Courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer? Why, it is this—wherever there is but little business done in any court, those in power are induced not to place the strongest judge in that situation; then, the small portion of business to be done renders the judge less fit for his office; and so, by action and re-action, while the little business makes the bench and the bar less able, the inferior ability of the court still further reduces that little business.
Experiments have been tried to lighten the business of the Court of King’s Bench: but I do not find that any of them have answered the purpose for which they were instituted. The first of these attempts was made in the year 1821, when it was arranged that the Chief Justice should sit in one court, and a puisne judge in another, at the same time; but never did any arrangement fail more completely. The court Edition: current; Page: [19] in which the puisne judge sat remained almost idle, while the other court was as constantly preferred, and nearly as much overloaded as before. Little else was effected but a great inconvenience both to practitioners and suitors, by the passing and repassing from court to court. In fact, it is not in the power of the courts, even were all monopolies and other restrictions done away, to distribute business equally, as long as the suitors are left free to choose their tribunal. There will always be a favourite court; and the circumstance of its being preferred tends to make it more deserving of preference; for if the favour towards it began in mere caprice, the great amount of business draws thither the best practitioners, to say nothing of judges; and the better the court, the greater will be its business. The same action and re-action will operate favourably, which I before showed in its unfavourable effects where a court was declining—Possunt quia posse videntur. The experiment of 1821, having failed entirely, was not repeated.
Another attempt has subsequently been made to relieve the Court of King’s Bench from the pressure of term business, which must always bear a proportion to the Nisi Prius causes. This system is still going on under the bill brought into the House by the present Chancellor, and of which though he was induced to patronise it officially when Solicitor-General, I have reason to believe he never much approved. As this arrangement is compulsory, the client having no choice, it cannot well fail; but I heartily wish that it had failed, for it has done much mischief, and is certainly one of the worst changes that has ever taken place. It is true, the great pressure of business requires that something should be done; but it is equally true that the right thing has not been adopted; for, where the King’s Bench sits, with the Chief Justice presiding—where the suitors resort—where the bar is mustered—where the public attend—where all the council and attorneys appear—where the business is disposed of, as it ought to be, gravely and deliberately, with the eyes of mankind, with the eyes of the bar, as well as of the world at large, turned on the proceedings—would not every one point to that as the place in which all important legal questions ought to be decided? Would not any one, on the other hand, say, if another court were constituted in a sort of back room, where three judges were sitting—where the only persons present, besides the judges, were the counsel and attorney employed on either side of the cause that was pending—where there was no audience, and the public eye was entirely directed not upon but from that to the other court—would not any one, I ask, declare, that a court so circumstanced was the place in which the trifling business alone should be transacted? These, I think, would be but natural conclusions; and yet if the matter be stated exactly the other way, it will be far nearer the truth. Of the really important business, as regards both its difficulty and importance to the law, and, indeed, to the suitor, a very large proportion is done in that back room, and before those three judges; it is done in a corner, and, I may say, disposed of behind people’s backs, with only the attendance of the attorney and barrister on each side, or, at most, with the presence of these and of the practitioners waiting for the next cause; and as the court is not frequented Edition: current; Page: [20] by the public any more than the profession, the business may certainly be said to be transacted without due publicity and solemnity. Thus we see, that by this arrangement, while the most interesting matter is overlooked, trifling business and points of no importance are brought forward with all possible observation:—a motion for judgment as against the casual ejector, which is a motion of course—a motion to refer a bill to the master to compute principal and interest—for judgment, as in case of a nonsuit—and a thousand others, either of course or of the most trifling moment, are heard, with the utmost publicity, before the whole court—before the whole bar—before the whole body of attorneys—before the whole public—all of which might be settled by the three judges in a corner, or by any one of them, or by any one of their clerks. The consequence is, that much time is lost to the full court, while the most important business—special arguments, raising the greatest legal questions—new trials, involving both matters of law and fact affecting large interests;—and the crown-paper, comprehending all the questions from sessions, are obliged to be heard in the private and unsatisfactory manner I have described. I wish this system to be remedied, because it is a great and growing evil. . . . .
3. I now pass to the civil law courts; and their constitution I touch with a tender, and, I may say, a trembling hand, knowing that, from my little experience of their practice, I am scarcely competent to discourse of them; for I profess to speak only from such knowledge as I have obtained incidentally by practising in the two courts of appeal, the High Court of Delegates and the Cockpit, where I have been occasionally associated with the civilians. The observations I have to make on this part of the subject resolve themselves, entirely, into those which I would offer upon the manner in which their judges are appointed and paid. In the first place, I would have them better paid than they are now, a reform to which I would fain hope there may be no serious objection on their part, averse, as I know them, generally, to all change. I think they are underpaid in respect of the most important part of their functions. The judge of the Court of Admiralty, who has the highest situation, or almost the highest, among the judges of the land (for there is none of them who decides upon questions of greater delicacy and moment, in a national view, or involving a larger amount of property)—this great dignitary of the law has 2,500l. a-year salary only. The rest of his income is composed of fees, and these are little or nothing during peace. But then, in time of war, they amount to 7,000l. or 8,000l. per annum. I profess not to like the notion of a functionary, who has so many calls, as the judge of the Admiralty Court, for dealing with the most delicate neutral questions—for drawing up manifestoes and giving opinions on those questions, and advising the crown in matters of public policy bearing on our relations with foreign states;—I like not, I say, the notion of such a personage being subject to the dreadful bias (and here, again, I am speaking on general principles only, and with no personal reference whatever) which he is likely to receive, from the circumstance of his having a salary of 2,500l. per annum only, if a state of peace continue, and between 10,000l. or 11,000l. a-year, if it be succeeded by war. . . . . .
Edition: current; Page: [21]
The other remark, which I have to offer on these courts, I would strongly press upon the consideration of the House; it relates to the mode in which their judges are appointed. Is it a fit thing, I ask, now, when Popery is no longer cherished or even respected, indeed hardly tolerated, among us—that one of its worst practices should remain, the appointment of some of the most eminent judges in the civil law courts by prelates of the church? I except, indeed, the judge of the High Court of Admiralty, because his commission proceeds from the Lord High Admiral; but I speak of all those who preside in the Consistorial Courts—who determine the most grave and delicate questions of spiritual law, marriage and divorce, and may decide on the disposition by will of all the personalty of the kingdom. Is it a fit thing that the judges in these most important matters should be appointed, not by the Crown, not by removable and responsible officers of the Crown—but by the Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of London, who are neither removable nor responsible—who are not lawyers—who are not statesmen—who ought to be no politicians—who are, indeed, priests of the highest order, but not, on that account, the most proper persons to appoint judges of the highest order? So it is in the province of York, where the judges are appointed by the archbishop; so in all other consistorial courts, where the judges are appointed by the bishops of the respective dioceses in which they are situated. From their courts an appeal lies, it is true, to the Court of Delegates, in the last resort; but so far from this affording an adequate remedy, it is an additional evil; for I will venture to affirm, that the Delegates is one of the worse-constituted courts which was ever appointed, and that the course of its proceedings forms one of the greatest mockeries of appeal ever conceived by man: and I shall demonstrate this to you in a very few words. The court is thus formed:—You take three judges from the common-law courts, one from each; to these you add some half-dozen civil lawyers, advocates from Doctors’ Commons, who the day before may have been practising in those courts, but who happen not to have been in the particular cause, in respect of which the appeal has been asserted. Now, only see what the consequence of this must be. The civilians forming the majority of the delegates are, of necessity, men who have no practice, or the very youngest of the doctors. So that you absolutely appeal from the three great judges of the civil and maritime courts, from the sentences of Sir William Scott, Sir John Nicholl, and Sir Christopher Robinson—of those learned and experienced men, who are to us the great luminaries of the civil law—the venerated oracles best fitted to guide our path through all the difficulties of that branch of the science, and open to us its dark passages—you appeal from them to judges, the majority of whom must, of necessity, be the advocates the least employed in the courts where those great authorities preside, the most recently admitted to those courts, and the most unqualified to pronounce soundly on their proceedings, if it were decent that they should pronounce at all; for, out of so small a bar, the chances are that the three or four eminent advocates have been employed in the case under appeal. Thus the absurdity is really much the same as if you were to appeal from a solemn and elaborate judgment, Edition: current; Page: [22] pronounced by my Lord Tenterden, Mr. Justice Bayley, Mr. Justice Holroyd, and Mr. Justice Littledale, to the judgment of three young barristers, called but the day before, and three older ones, who never could obtain any practice. . . . . .
4. I next come to speak of the Privy Council; a very important judicature, and of which the members discharge as momentous duties as any of the judges of this country, having to determine not only upon questions of colonial law in plantation cases, but to sit also as judges, in the last resort, of all prize causes. The point, however, to which I more immediately address myself on this head is, that they hear and decide upon all our plantation appeals. They are thus made the supreme judges, in the last resort, over every one of your foreign settlements, whether situated in those immense territories which you possess in the East, where you and a trading company together rule over not less than seventy millions of subjects; or established among those rich and populous islands which stud the Indian Ocean, and form the great Eastern Archipelago; or have their stations in those lands, part lying within the tropics, part stretching towards the pole, peopled by various castes differing widely in habits, still more widely in privileges, great in numbers, abounding in wealth, extremely unsettled in their notions of right, and excessively litigious, as all the children of the New World are supposed to be, both from their physical and political constitution. All this immense jurisdiction over the rights of property and person, over rights political and legal, and over all the questions growing out of such a vast and varied province, is exercised by the Privy Council, unaided and alone. It is obvious that, from the mere distance of those colonies, and the immense variety of matters arising in them, foreign to our habits, and beyond the scope of our knowledge, any judicial tribunal in this country must of necessity be an extremely inadequate court of review. But what adds incredibly to the difficulty is, that hardly any two of the colonies can be named which have the same law; and in the greater number the law is wholly unlike our own. In some settlements it is the Dutch law, in others the Spanish, in others the French, in others the Danish. In our Eastern possessions these variations are, if possible, yet greater: while one territory is swayed by the Mohammedan law, another is ruled by the native or Hindu law; and this again, in some of our possessions, is qualified or superseded by the law of Buddha, the English jurisprudence being confined to the handful of British settlers, and the inhabitants of the three Presidencies. All those laws must come, in their turns, in review, before the necessarily ignorant Privy Councillor, after the learned doctors in each have differed. . . . . .
The Privy Council, which ought to be held more regularly than any other court, sits far less constantly than any, having neither a regular bench nor a regular bar. It only meets on certain extraordinary days—the 30th of January, the Feast of the Purification, some day in May, Midsummer-day, and a few others. I find that, on an average of twelve years, ending 1826, it sat in each year nine days, to dispose of all the appeals from all the British subjects in India; from our own civil Edition: current; Page: [23] courts, to the jurisdiction of which all our subjects are locally amenable, throughout the wide extent of the several Presidencies of Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras; to dispose of all the causes which come up to the three several native courts of last resort, the Sudder Adawluts, from the inferior courts of Zilla and Circuit, comprising all contested suits between the Hindoos, the half-caste people, and the Mahomedan inhabitants. But in the same nine days are to be disposed of all the appeals from Ceylon, the Mauritius, the Cape, and New Holland; from our colonies in the West Indies and in North America; from our settlements in the Mediterranean, and from the islands in the Channel;—nine days’ sittings are deemed sufficient for the decision of the whole. But nine days do not suffice, nor anything like it, for this purpose; and the summary I have in my hand demonstrates it both by what it contains, and by what it does not. It appears that, in all those twelve years taken together, the appeals have amounted to but few in number. I marvel that they are so few—and yet I marvel not; for, in point of fact, you have no adequate tribunal to dispose of them; and the want of such a tribunal is an absolute denial of justice to the subjects of the Crown in those colonies. The total number is only 467; but, including about 50, which came from India, and appear not to have been regularly entered, though they are still undisposed of, there are 517. Of these, 243 only have been disposed of; but only 129 have been heard, for the others were either compromised, from hopelessness owing to the delay which had intervened between the appeal and the sentence, or dismissed for want of prosecution. Consequently, the Privy Council must have heard ten or eleven appeals only by the year, or little more than one in the course of each day’s sitting. Again, of the 129 which were heard and disposed of, no less than 56 were decided against the original sentences; which were altered, and, generally speaking, wholly reversed. Now, 56 out of 129 is a very large proportion, little less than one-half; and clearly shows that the limited number of appeals must have arisen, not from the want of cases where revision was required, but from the apprehension of finding no adequate court of review, or no convenient dispatch of business. And that the sentences in the colonies should oftentimes be found ill-digested, or hasty, or ignorant, can be no matter of astonishment, when we find a bold lieutenant-general lord chancellor in one court, and an enterprising captain president in another; and a worthy major officiating as judge-advocate in a third. In many of these cases, a gallant and unlearned lord chancellor has decided, in the court below, points of the greatest legal nicety; and the judges of appeal, who are to set him right here, are chosen without much more regard to legal aptitude; for you are not to suppose that the business of these nine days upon which they sit is all transacted before lawyers: one lawyer there may be, but the rest are laymen. . . .
5. I now, Sir, come to the administration of law in the country, by justices of peace; and I approach this jurisdiction with fear and trembling, when I reflect on what Mr. Windham was accustomed to say, that he dreaded to talk of the game-laws in a House composed of sportsmen; and so, too, I dread to talk of the quorum in an assembly of Edition: current; Page: [24] magistrates. . . . . . Nevertheless, considering the changes which have been effected in modern times, I cannot help thinking it worth inquiry, whether some amendment might not be made in our justice-of-peace system? The first doubt which strikes me is, if it be fit that they should be appointed as they are, merely by the lords lieutenants of counties, without the interference of the Crown’s responsible ministers. It is true that the lord chancellor issues the commission, but it is the lord lieutenant who designates the persons to be comprehended in it. . . . . On looking at the description of persons who are put into the commission, I am not at all satisfied that the choice is made with competent discretion; and upon this part of the question I may as well declare at once, that I have very great doubts as to the expediency of making clergymen magistrates. This is a course which, whenever it can be done conveniently, I should certainly be glad to see changed, unless in counties where there are very few resident lay proprietors. . . . . . Appointed, then, by irresponsible advisers, and irremovable without a conviction, let us now see what is the authority of men so chosen and so secure. . . . . .
In the first place, they have the privilege of granting or withholding licenses. As we all know, it lies in the breasts of two justices of the peace to give or to refuse this important privilege. It is in their absolute power to give a license to one of the most unfit persons possible; and it is in their power to refuse a license to one of the most fit persons possible. They may continue a license to some person who has had it but a twelvemonth, and who, during that twelvemonth, has made his house a nuisance to the whole neighbourhood; or they may take away a license from a house to which it has been attached for a century, and the enjoyment of which has not only been attended by no evil, but has been productive of great public benefit. And all this, be it observed, they do without even the shadow of control. There is no rule more certain than that a mandamus does not lie to compel justices either to grant or withhold a license. I hardly ever remember moving for one; and I only once recollect a rule being granted,—it was on the motion of my honourable and learned friend, the Solicitor-General. But I know that great astonishment was expressed on the occasion; that every one asked what he could have stated to make the court listen to the application; that all took for granted it would be discharged, as a matter of course; which it accordingly was, in less time than I have taken to relate the circumstance. What other control is there over the conduct of the licensing magistrate? I shall be told that he may be proceeded against, either by a criminal information, or by impeachment. As to the latter, no man of common sense would dream of impeaching a magistrate, any more than he would think now-a-days of impeaching a minister. Then, as to proceeding by criminal information:—In the first place it is necessary, in order even to obtain the rule, to produce affidavits, that the magistrate has been influenced by wilful and corrupt motives: not merely affidavits of belief in those who swear, but of facts proving him guilty of malversation in his office. Then suppose, as not unfrequently happens, a rule obtained on this ex-parte statement; the Edition: current; Page: [25] magistrate answers the charges on oath; he swears last, and may touch many points never anticipated by the other party, consequently not answered; and unless the alleged facts remain, upon the discussion, undeniable, and the guilt to be inferred from them seems as clear as the light of day, the rule is discharged with costs. The difficulty of proving corruption is rendered almost insuperable, because all the magistrate has to do, in order to defend himself from the consequences of granting or withholding a license, is to adopt the short course of saying nothing at the time—of keeping his own counsel—of abstaining from any statement of his reasons. Let him only give no reason for his conduct, and no power on earth can touch him. He may grant a license to a common brothel, or he may refuse a license to one of the most respectable inns on the North road; let him withhold his reasons, and his conduct remains unquestionable; although the real motive by which he is actuated may be, that he is in the habit of using the one house, and that the landlord of the other will not suffer him to use it in the same way. Unless you can show that he has himself stated his motives, or that there are circumstances so strong against him as amount to conviction, you are prevented from even instituting an inquiry on the subject. Thus absolute is the authority of the magistrate with regard to licensing. . . . . .
Nor is the licensing power of the magistracy that in which alone great abuses exist. They prevail wheresoever their authority is exercised; in the commitments for offences against the game-laws; in dealing with petty offences against property; in taking cognizance of little assaults, especially on officers; in summary convictions for non-payment of tithes, and a number of other matters affecting the liberties and property of the subject; and yet, for their conduct in all of these matters, they are not amenable to any superior power, provided, as I have said before, they only keep their own counsel, and abstain from stating the reasons by which they have been actuated, should their motives be evil. There is not a worse constituted tribunal on the face of the earth, not even that of the Turkish cadi, than that at which summary convictions on the game-laws constantly take place; I mean, a bench or a brace of sporting justices. . . . . From their decisions on those points, where their passions are the most likely to mislead them, no appeal in reality lies to a more calm and unprejudiced tribunal; for, unless they set out any matter illegal on the face of the conviction, you remove the record in vain. Equally supreme are they in cases where, sitting in a body at quarter-sessions, they decide upon the most important rights of liberty and property. Let it be remembered that they can sentence to almost unlimited imprisonment, to whipping, to fine, nay, to transportation for seven and fourteen years. I have shuddered to see the way in which these extensive powers are sometimes exercised by a jurisdiction not responsible for its acts. It is said that the magistracy ought not to be responsible, because it is not paid; but we ought not to forget that as gold itself may be bought too dear, so may economy; money may be saved at too high a price. Mark the difference of responsibility between the quarter-sessions and one of the superior courts of the kingdom. In Edition: current; Page: [26] the King’s Bench, the name of the judge who pronounces the judgment is known, and the venerable magistrate stands before the country in his own proper person, always placed at the bar of public opinion. Here it is Lord Tenterden—it is Mr. Justice Bayley, by their names: in the other case, it is merely the quarter-sessions, which, as Swift says, is nobody’s name. The individual magistrates composing it are not thought of; their names are not even published. It is a fluctuating body. If the same individuals always sat in the court, there might be some approach to responsibility. At present there is none; and where there is no responsibility, injustice will occasionally be committed, as long as men are men. It would be some correction of the evil, if the number of magistrates was fixed; if their names were always known in connexion with their acts; and if they were more easily removable on proof of their misconduct. Then comes the question—Is it, after all, gratuitous service? We are told that we cannot visit the magistrates severely, or even watch them very strictly, because they volunteer their duty, and receive no remuneration for their trouble. But although they have no money for it, they may have money’s worth. Cheap justice, Sir, is a very good thing; but costly justice is much better than cheap injustice. If I saw clearly the means by which the magistrates could be paid, and by which, therefore, a more correct discharge of the magisterial duties might be insured, I would certainly prefer paying them in money to allowing them to receive money’s worth by jobs, and other violations of their duty. Not only may the magistrate himself receive compensation in money’s worth; he may receive it in hard money by his servants. The fees of a justice’s clerk amount to a little income, often to many times a man’s wages. I have heard of a reverend justice in the country having a clerk whose emoluments he wished to increase, and therefore he had him appointed surveyor of weights and measures, with a salary of a guinea and a half a-week. This person appointed a deputy, to whom he gave five shillings and sixpence, and who did all the duty. These circumstances came under the consideration of his brother justices; when, after a strenuous opposition, and, among others, on the part of the gentleman who communicates the occurrence in a letter now lying before me, it was decided, not only not to remove the first appointed person, who it was proved was doing nothing, but to swear in the other as his assistant! My friend is not entirely without suspicion that this functionary, having so small a remuneration as five shillings and sixpence a-week, can only have undertaken the duty with a view of increasing it by some understanding with the people whose weights and measures it is his duty to superintend.
The operation of pecuniary motives in matters connected with the magistracy is more extensive than may at first sight appear. There was a Bill introduced by the Right Honourable Gentleman opposite for extending the payment of expenses of witnesses and prosecutors out of the county rates. It is not to be doubted that it has greatly increased the number of commitments, and has been the cause of many persons being brought to trial who ought to have been discharged by the magistrates. The habit of committing, from this and other causes, has grievously Edition: current; Page: [27] increased everywhere of late, and especially of boys. Eighteen hundred and odd, many of them mere children, have been committed in the Warwick district during the last seven years. Nor is this a trifling evil. People do not come out of gaol as they went in. A boy may enter the prison-gate merely as a robber of an orchard; he may come out of it “fit for”—I will not say “treasons”—but certainly “stratagems and spoils.” Many are the inducements, independent of any legislative encouragement, to these commitments. The justice thinks he gains credit by them. He has the glory of being commemorated at the assizes before the lord judge, and the sheriff, and the grand jury, and all who read the Crown Calendar. On that solemn occasion, he has the gratification of hearing it fly from mouth to mouth—“He is a monstrous good magistrate; no man commits so many persons.” Then there is the lesser glory acquired among neighbours; into whose pockets they are the means of putting money, by making them prosecutors and witnesses in petty criminal cases; and thus converting (as Sir Eardley Wilmot says) their journey of duty into a jaunt of pleasure to the assizes. The reputation of activity is very seducing to a magistrate; but I have known it curiously combined with things more solid than empty praise. In a certain town, which I am well acquainted with, one suburb was peopled by Irishmen and Scots, who were wont to fight on every marketday a good deal, at fair tides a good deal more, but without any serious affray taking place. Besides these two classes of the king’s subjects, there also dwelt in those parts two justices of the king, assigned to keep the peace; for the better conserving of which they repaired at the hour of fight to an alehouse, conveniently situated hard by the scene of action, and there took their seat with a punch-bowl full of warrants, ready to fill up. If the Irish happened to be victorious, the Scots came one after another and applied for commitments against those who had assaulted them. The dispatch with which warrants, at least, if not justice, were administered, was notable. Then came the other party, and swore to as many assaults upon them; and justice being even-handed, they, too, had their desire gratified; until the bowl was, by degrees, emptied of its paper investment, and a metallic currency, by like degrees, took its place.
Some of these details may be ludicrous; but the general subject is a most serious and a most important one, because these facts show the manner in which justice is administered to the people out of sight of the public, and out of reach of the higher courts of law. It is through the magistracy, more than through any other agency—except, indeed, that of the tax-gatherer—that the people are brought directly into contact with the government of the country; and this is the measure of justice with which, when they approach it, they are treated by functionaries irresponsible for their proceedings. A justice of the peace, whether in his own parlour or on the bench—whether employed in summary convictions, or in enforcing what is called, after a very worthy friend of mine, Mr. Nicholson Calvert’s Act (one of the worst in the statute-book, which I hope to see repealed, and which I trust its excellent author will very long survive)—is never an ostensible individual, responsible Edition: current; Page: [28] in his own proper person to public opinion; hardly ever, unless he chooses by some indiscretion to make himself so, amenable to a higher and purer judicature.’*

This does not profess to be a complete enumeration of our courts, nor shall we pretend to fill it up. We shall only mention such names as are familiar to all, and occur to us at the moment. In the first place, there is the great class of courts—the courts of equity, which, in respect to the mass of property they dispose of, are the most important of all—including the Chancellor’s Court, the Vice-Chancellor’s, the Rolls Court, the courts of the masters in chancery, the commissioners in equity, and, for aught we know, more. Then we have our small-debt courts of all descriptions, courts of requests, courts of conscience; also county courts, barons’ courts, courts leet, several provincial courts of the Bishopric of Durham, the Duchy of Lancaster, &c.; coroners’ inquests, grand juries, and more, if we could recollect them.
It is perfectly certain that, with such a confused supply of instruments, the business of judicature must be wretchedly performed; and the phenomenon is the more hideous, when it is discovered that the mode of supplying the proper instruments is so perfectly simple, and the reason of the case so clear and irresistible.—England has been blessed with a legislature. Nothing which required amendment ever escaped its clear and virtuous intelligence.
In this jumble of courts—one intrusted with one fraction of the business of judicature, another with another, according to no plan or system, there is one peculiarity, unknown to any law but the English,—we mean, the courts set apart for that which is called equity. This word equity has propagated an erroneous notion with respect to these courts, as if it was their business to relax the strictness of law, and supersede its provisions, when the operation of them appeared to bear hard upon one of the parties. If this were true, courts of equity would be a still greater monster in judicature than they are.
So exceedingly imperfect in their original structure were the courts of law, that, in many cases, and those of the highest importance, they were altogether incompetent to the business. A remedy was found, by chance more than design. A high officer of the king took upon him, cautiously at first, and in select cases, to yield the remedy which was so much required. The abuse (for such it was) being found convenient, was allowed to go on; and grew, by degrees, into the established system which we now behold, of judicature for the principal part of the Edition: current; Page: [29] property of the country. This mode of legislating was agreeable to the imbecility of the age. What grew up of its own accord saved all expense of thought, which was not very plentiful or the exercise of it very agreeable. And the institutions of government grew, as Sir James Mackintosh thinks they ought to do, like trees, by a sort of vegetative process; reason, according to this hypothesis, being a second-rate guide in the affairs of men; foresight, plan, combination, pregnant with delusion and miscarriage. Our law tree has certainly grown to a notable bulk, whatever the quality of its timber.
Reason, certainly, in this matter, had it been applied to, would have taken a different course from the one pursued; it would have corrected the defects in the courts of law, which unfitted them for the administration of justice, in a certain important class of cases; and would thus have secured the all-important ends of law, by placing it in the same hands in all its departments, instead of resorting to the wretched makeshift of letting a new set of hands take up what it wanted only a salutary alteration to enable the old to perform.
Lord Erskine describes the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in the following words:—

‘The jurisdiction of this high court, according to the great authority above alluded to, became necessary—

1. When the principles of the law by which the ordinary courts were guided gave a right, but where their powers (for the reasons I have adverted to) were not sufficient to afford a complete remedy.
2. Where the courts of ordinary jurisdiction were made instruments of injustice.
3. Where they gave no right, but where, upon the principles of universal justice, the interference of the judicial power became necessary to prevent a wrong, when positive law was silent.
4. To remove impediments to the fair decision of a question in other courts.
5. To provide for the safety of property in dispute, pending a litigation in the ordinary courts.
6. To prevent the assertion of doubtful rights in a manner which might be productive of irreparable injury.
7. To prevent injury to a third person by the doubtful title of others.
8. To put a bound to vexatious and oppressive litigation.
9. To compel a discovery, which was beyond the customary powers of other courts.
10. To preserve testimony.’


—Armata, Part II. p. 147.


There is only one thing more, on which we think it necessary at present to remark, in regard to our judicial establishment. How defective soever it is in all other respects, it is by far the most defective in regard to that on which the efficiency of the Edition: current; Page: [30] whole depends—the business of appeal. Of the badness of our arrangements for the indispensable security of appeal, we are not qualified to speak in detail, nor is it necessary. That the means are ill adapted to the end is notorious; and that to a degree disgraceful to the Legislature—which looks on such a grievance with indifference, and to the people who endure the apathy of such a Legislature.
A great part of the judicial business done in England is altogether without the benefit of appeal; and to that extent the people are deprived of the best security for good judicature. We have seen what Lord Brougham has said on the absence of all remedy for the misconduct of justices of the peace. And when we consider that theirs is the jurisdiction which mostly concerns the great mass of the people, and that it is left in this state to the present hour, it reads a lesson on the nature of aristocratic government. This is a specimen of disregard of the interests of the mass of the people, continued from generation to generation, which is not exceeded by anything recorded of the most barbarous governments which have at any time been the scourge of any portion of the human race.
The provision for appeal from the decisions of the courts of common law is so extremely defective, that the benefit of it is really very little known. The defects, in the way of evidence, of the original tribunals, are remedied by a new trial, that is, with great expense, and still without appeal. Difficult questions of law are referred to more judges than one, and there is a writ of error to the House of Lords. But this is far from coming up to the idea of a regular appeal to a set of judges, regularly set apart for the business of appeal, revising the whole proceedings, and having this for their exclusive duty.—N.B. Nothing is of more importance in judicature, than to keep the business of original and that of appellate jurisdiction perfectly distinct. The judge in original jurisdiction should not have mixed with that jurisdiction the business of jurisdiction in appeal. They are distinct functions, which are never well performed when they are jumbled together. This is a first principle in jurisprudence.
The only real court of appeal we have upon this principle, in England, is the House of Lords. We shall not think of explaining the utter unfitness of that court, as hitherto constituted, to be a court of appeal, for there is but one opinion on the subject. And we have only to add, that the business of appeal is as ill provided for, in the case of the equity courts, as in that of the courts of common law. The Chancellor, who is a judge of original jurisdiction, and thereby unfitted to be a judge in Edition: current; Page: [31] appeal, receives appeals from the inferior equity courts; and another appeal lies from him to the House of Lords, where again he is substantially the judge. This, then, is a second stage of appeal, with all its burthen of expense, which is only an appeal from the same to the same. This looks like the sport with human happiness of some malignant demon, rather than the deliberate arrangements of human reason for human good.
After having seen what judges are required for the best administration of law, we come to inquire by what proceedings the business they are called upon to accomplish may best be performed. This is the third and last of the topics which require the attention of the law reformer. The rectification of the text of the law, the best mode of allotting the services of the judges, and the best mode of judicial operation,—these things sufficiently provided for, complete the arrangements for the best administration of justice.
We shall proceed in the illustration of this last topic in the same manner as we have done in the two preceding. We shall, in the first place, show how simply and easily common sense arrives at the expedients which are best adapted to the end in view. And then we shall adduce some evidence, to show how widely English law has departed from the proper proceedings, and how great the necessity is of a speedy and thorough reform.
It is evident, when a judge is called upon to determine which of two litigant parties is in the right, his inquiry divides itself into two stages. The first thing he has to determine is—what is the point on which the question of right hinges. That is sometimes a point of law, but most frequently it is a point of fact. Some matter of fact, affirmed on the one side, denied on the other, is that which determines, according as it is established by evidence, or not, to which of the two litigants the right to the object in dispute belongs.
This is a doctrine acted upon by English law; and so far it is distinguished to its advantage from other systems of law, in almost all of which this most important object is entirely neglected. In almost all other systems of law, the parties, in bringing forward their respective cases, are allowed to heap together whatever appears to them to improve their chance of a favourable decision,—matters secondary as well as primary,—collateral as well as direct,—irrelevant as well as those to the purpose; and even evidence, as well as the matters which are to be proved.
English law has seen, that the first business of the judge, on receiving the mass of heterogeneous matter which parties are Edition: current; Page: [32] prone to urge upon him, is—to disentangle the mass—to strip from it everything which is superfluous and irrelevant, and fix upon that which he perceives to involve the essence of the dispute.
Reason, at the first inspection, sees the necessity of this procedure to a clear understanding and satisfactory solution of the question involved in the allegations of the parties. Unless the judge is contented to decide in the midst of confusion, he must make this separation for himself sooner or later; and the advantage, as we shall afterwards see, is immense of making it at the beginning. English law has been so fully sensible of the importance of it, that it has provided a process for the purpose. It has what it calls pleadings, the object of which is to elicit what it calls the issue,—that is, some point affirmed on the one side, denied on the other, on which the question of right depends.
If anything, in the whole process of the judicial inquiry, be a business for the mind of the judge, this is. On the right or wrong determination of the point on which the decision is to turn, the decision itself is likely to be right or wrong. This is of too much importance to be intrusted to anybody but the judge. Let us see, then, what common sense may recommend to us as the course which it is best for him to adopt in proceeding to this determination.
It is clear, first of all, that he must have information. The parties must state their case to him. The question is, should this be done by writing, or in person? A moment’s reflection is surely sufficient to determine that question. A writing can answer no questions. A writing is very apt to be defective. If the party himself is present, not a moment’s time is lost. Whatever information is necessary to illuminate the mind of the judge, a question from the judge produces immediately; and he never ceases putting question after question till he is satisfied that he has the whole case before him. This is what is called vivâ voce pleading; and its superiority to any mode of pleading by writing is too evident to need any further illustration. The simplicity and efficiency of the procedure becomes obvious at once. The plaintiff makes application to the judge, according to some convenient and established form. Admitted to the presence of the judge, he states his claim, and indicates the party against whom it is brought. The questions of the judge then commence. Your claim being as you say, on what is it grounded? It may happen that the ground on which the plaintiff lays his claim will not sustain it. The judge declares so, and the suit is terminated. There is no occasion to Edition: current; Page: [33] give the party against whom it is brought the trouble of a single attendance. This, however, is not the common case. The plaintiff commonly adduces something which, if not rebutted, would establish his claim. In that case, it is necessary that the defendant should be summoned, to answer to the claim. Both parties appear in the presence of the judge. The defendant is told what the claim is against him, and what the ground alleged by the plaintiff. Let us suppose the commonest case—an allegation of debt. Let us suppose, also, the ground of claim which is brought by the plaintiff to be—sale of a horse. He says the defendant bought of him a horse for 20l., but has never paid him. The defendant is then asked what he has to say to this ground of claim; and he may deny the fact. He may deny that he ever bought a horse of the plaintiff. The issue, in that case, is found immediately. Here is a fact, affirmed on the one side, denied on the other, which decides the question in dispute. After this, there only remains the evidence of the fact, the process for taking which is called the trial, and constitutes the second part of the judicial investigation. The defendant, however, may not perhaps deny the fact of having purchased the horse, but may affirm that he paid for him. In that case there is another issue: namely, whether he paid for him or not.
Sometimes the allegations are very complicated; and it is only after a long series of questions that the point which really determines the question is elicited.
Not only is this mode of determining the issue, or what the point is on which the whole question hinges, of the importance which we have seen it is for clearing the way of the judge,—it is of vast importance in many other respects. Persons who have made choice of this mode of proceeding—of whom we have various instances among the servants of the Indian government—declare that its efficacy is most surprising in abridging litigation; that in nine instances out of ten the question of right, through the interrogations of the judge, and the admissions of the parties, becomes apparent, at the first hearing of the case, to the parties themselves; and the judge at once pronounces his decision. The courts of law in this manner operate as conciliation courts: this mode of pleading naturally makes them such, and with infinite advantages above all other conciliation courts, because there is here full and complete knowledge of the cause by him who best knows the use to be made of it.
To what a degree the mode of pleading in English law departs from this rational course, we shall presently produce the testimony of English lawyers themselves to establish. First of Edition: current; Page: [34] all, it is in writing, and therefore deprived of all the inestimable advantages of vivâ voce examination. Next, this important part of the judicial inquiry is not performed by the judge at all. It is performed by the parties themselves, and their legal advisers, according to the following process:—A paper is prepared on the part of the plaintiff: this is lodged in a certain office: another paper is prepared on the part of the defendant, and that also is lodged in an office. Those papers and counter-papers may go on to a considerable number. All this while the elucidation of the truth is not the object which is aimed at by any of the parties concerned in this strange correspondence. The object of each of the parties is to obscure it, as far as it is not in his favour, to the utmost possible degree. The proceedings are never submitted to the judge: they are all finished without his being made acquainted with the matter. The correspondence is seen by him, for the first time, when the issue is brought before him for trial,—that is, when the matter-of-fact, on which the question of right depends, as settled, through this marvellous kind of intercourse, by the parties themselves, is to be determined by evidence.
How unlike this is to a rational proceeding, we shall not stay to enforce. It suffices to say, that in practice it led into such a tissue of intricacies and subtleties, that it was at last discovered to be more injurious than useful to the cause of justice, and has been to a great degree discarded by the courts themselves. But what have the courts done to supply its place? Nothing at all. They allow what they call the general issue to be pleaded: in other words, they allow the defendant to deny, in the most general terms, the justice of the plaintiff’s claim, or accusation: and in all such cases dispense with the process of pleading: cut off as useless the first essential part of the judicial inquiry—that which determines the point whereon the question of right depends. The cause comes on for trial, that is for the hearing of evidence, without its being known what it is for which evidence is required. Lawyers make speeches on one side; lawyers make speeches on the other side; and the judge gathers up, the best way he can, by this extempore process, the point or points in which the merits of the case are involved. Often he does not gather it up at all; and the whole proceeding is a mass of confusion. Evidence is taken on many points, which it is altogether useless to settle; very often the decision is made to turn on the wrong point. And one great evil is constant. Whereas the parties, when the issue is settled beforehand, are called upon to produce witnesses only to the point which decides the question, they are Edition: current; Page: [35] put to the expense, in this mode of procedure, of having witnesses ready to prove every point on which, by conjecture, the decision may possibly turn.
The following picture by Lord Brougham is of so much importance, that we cannot forbear inserting it, though it occupies a greater than the convenient space:—

‘We are now to suppose the parties in court, and called upon to state their cases, the claim of one and defence of the other. Anciently, this pleading, as it is termed, was by word of mouth; but in more modern times it has been carried on in writing. Originally, too, pleas were in French; afterwards in Latin; and, for a century past, by a great, but most salutary innovation, doubtless much reviled and dreaded in its day, they have been conducted in English. . . . . Lord Coke deemed special pleading so delightful a science, that its very name was derived, according to him, from its pleasurable nature—“Quia bene placitare omnibus placet.” Incapable of inventing a new pleasure, I would fain restore a lost one, by bringing back pleading to somewhat of its pristine state, when it gave our ancestors such exquisite recreation. Certain it is that our deviation from the old rules in this branch of the law has been attended with evil effects. Those rules, as Lord Mansfield once said, were founded in reason and good sense; accuracy and justice was their object, and in the details much of ingenuity and subtlety were displayed. But by degrees the good sense has disappeared, and the ingenuity and subtlety have increased beyond measure, and been oftentimes misdirected: nay, to such a pitch have the changes proceeded, that at last subtlety has superseded sense—accuracy and justice are well nigh lost sight of; and ingenuity is exhausted in devising pretexts for prolixity and means of stratagem. In these really hurtful innovations, the courts of law have been the far too ready accomplices; and the legislature has been a most willing instrument to increase the evil, by sanctioning, almost as a matter of course, in each new act, the power of pleading the general issue. . . . .
I regret to say, that the last century and a half has witnessed great and prejudicial alterations in the original plan: so that the record, in the great majority of cases, instead of exhibiting a plain view of what each party is prepared to prove, contains an endless multitude of words, from which, if the real matter in dispute can be gathered at all, it is only by guess work, or by communications out of the record, relating to things of which it gives not even a hint. Let us look into this a little more narrowly. The count of a declaration should convey information as to the subject of the action; but it conveys no precise knowledge of the plaintiff’s demand, or indeed of what the suit is about. Take the instance of the Common Counts, as they are justly termed, in Assumpsit, being those constantly resorted to, and take the most common of these, the count for money had and received. I will take no advantage of the audience I speak before being unacquainted with legal niceties, in order to make merry with the venerable formalities of the art. All lawyers know how easy it would be in this place to raise a smile, at the least, by recounting Edition: current; Page: [36] the little fooleries of our draftsmen; but I disdain it, and will treat the subject precisely as if I were addressing professional men. The plaintiff declares that the defendant, being indebted to him for so much money had and received to the use of the said plaintiff, to wit, one thousand pounds, undertook and faithfully promised to pay it, but broke his engagement; and the count is thus framed, the self-same terms being invariably used, whatever be the cause of action which can be brought into court under this head. Now, observe how various the matters are which may be all described by the foregoing words. In the first place, such is the declaration for money paid by one individual to another, for the use and benefit of the plaintiff; this is what alone the words of the count imply, but to express this they are rarely indeed made use of. Secondly, the self-same terms are used on suing for money received on a consideration that fails, and used in the same way to describe all the endless variety of cases which can occur of such failure, as an estate sold with a bad title, and a deposit paid,—a horse sold with a concealed unsoundness, and so forth; thirdly, the same words are used when it is wished to recover money paid under mistake of fact; fourthly, to recover money paid by one person to a stakeholder, in consideration of an illegal contract made with another person; fifthly, money paid to revenue officers for releasing the goods illegally detained, of the person paying; sixthly, to try the right to any office, instead of bringing an assize; seventhly, to try the liability of the landlord for rates levied on his tenant. What information, then, does such a declaration give? It is impossible, on reading this count, to say which of the seven causes of action has arisen; and it is not merely those seven, for each one of them has a vast number of varieties, which are declared on in the same words. In actions of Trover the case is even worse. Suppose the case of a plaintiff suing for any chattel, as a gun, the declaration will be such as may apply equally to at least eight different heads, under each of which are many different causes of action. The words in all would be the very same—that the plaintiff was possessed of a gun, as of his own proper goods and chattels; that he accidentally lost it; that the defendant found it, and converted it to his use. Now this count describes only one case—that of a gun lost by its owner, and detained by the finder. But it is employed to mean, secondly, that the gun has been taken by the defendant, under pretence of some title, or in any way not felonious; thirdly, that it was deposited with the defendant, who refused to deliver it up; fourthly, that it was stopped in transitu, the price not having been paid; fifthly, that the plaintiff is the assignce of a bankrupt, and seeks to recover the gun, as having been sold after the bankruptcy of the vendor; sixthly, that the plaintiff has been improperly made a bankrupt, and sues the assignees to try the bankruptcy; seventhly, that his goods have been unlawfully taken, and he sues to try the validity of an execution, on any of the various grounds of fraud, &c., which impeach the validity of the process; eightly, that the gun has been misdelivered, or detained, by a warehouseman or carrier. All those causes of action differ from each other as much as different things can differ, and yet they are all stated in the declaration in the same way, and signified under the same form of words.
Edition: current; Page: [37]
The pleadings in cases where it might be expected that the greatest particularity would be given to the statement, actions upon torts to the person, are somewhat, but for the most part, not remarkably more definite and precise in their description. The declarations on the seduction of a wife, servant, or daughter, assault, and false imprisonment, are drawn so that you can say, no doubt, what the action is about, which you hardly ever can in cases of assumpsit or trover; but the same form of words is used, whatever the particular shape of the cause may be. Of the circumstances peculiar to the transaction, the pleadings tell the defendant nothing—they tell the counsel nothing—they tell the judge nothing. It may be said that the defendant must know the cause of action himself; but that does not always follow, especially if (which may be presumed barely possible, though it seems never to be thought so) the allegations are groundless. There is, however, one person who must know the cause of action, and that is the plaintiff. He ought, for the satisfaction of all concerned, to state it distinctly. The same may be said of the counts in trespass for taking goods. In trespass quare clausum fregit, perhaps, the description of the wrong done is more specific. But it happens that the circumstances here are of far less importance; damages are not in question; a shilling or so is to be recovered, the object of the action being almost always to try a right of property or an easement. In all other cases of trespass, where a knowledge of the wrong suffered is most material, the parties are left to fight, and the court to decide, in the dark; but in the case I have just alluded to, where a knowledge of the circumstances in which the trespass was committed is immaterial, everything is told them of which it is wholly unimportant that they should be informed; in a cumbrous way, no doubt, and with much fanciful statement, but still it is told. Actions for slaunder and libel, for malicious prosecutions, and malicious arrest, or holding to bail, with others on the case, are very particular, and form, certainly, an exception to the ordinary course of pleading; at least, as far as the declaration goes; no farther, as we shall presently see—for I now proceed to the next stage of the pleadings, namely, to the pleas which the defendant puts upon the record in answer to the plaintiff’s complaints.
In this stage of the cause we encounter the same evils, but in greater abundance; for they affect those actions on the case where the count is most precise. Generally speaking, it may be said that, if the plaintiff tells us nothing in his declaration, the defendant, in return, tells us as little in his plea; in that respect, at least, they are even. This is, perhaps, a consequence of the former evil; but, be that as it may, it ought to be remedied. The plaintiff ought to tell the defendant the real nature of his complaint, and the defendant ought to make him equally acquainted with the nature of his answer. If this were always done, perjury would not so often be committed; everything intended to be proved would be stated on each side; and the parties, knowing the evidence on which the respective statements must be established, would have an opportunity of examining into the character of the witnesses, and of procuring the best evidence to elucidate the point. At present, the mystery of pleading leaves them in doubt; and the vague and indistinct Edition: current; Page: [38] statements on the record, unaccompanied by other information, open a door to the entrance of falsehood in the witnesses, far wider than any you could open, by enabling them to get up proofs in answer to those expected from the opposite side. Whenever the parties fight each other by trick, on the record in the first instance, fencing to evade telling their grounds of contention, they renew the fight afterwards by perjury in court. I will now give the House some instances of the vagueness of this part of pleading.
In the indebitatus assumpsit, from which I took my first example, the general issue is non assumpsit. Now, under that plea, no less than eight different defences may be set up; as, for instance, a denial of the contract, payment, usury, gaming, infancy, coverture, accord and satisfaction, release. All these defences are entirely different, and yet they are all stated in the self-same words. So, too, in the action of trover; take our former case of the gun: the defendant, under the plea of “not guilty,” may set up as a defence that he is a gamekeeper, and took it by virtue of the statute of Charles II.; or that he had a lien upon it as a carrier for his general balance, and had, therefore, a right to detain it; or a particular lien for work done upon it; or that he had received it as a deposit, and was entitled to keep it; or that he had took it for toll, or detained it till passage money due by its owner were paid; or the reward due for saving it from shipwreck were given. Any one of these defences may be concealed under the plea of “not guilty,” without the possibility of the plaintiff discovering which it is that his adversary means to set up; so that every body will, I think, agree with me, that if the count teaches the court and opposite party little, the plea teaches them not a whit more.
2. The inconsistency of many of our rules of pleading forms the next head of complaint to which I shall direct your attention; and it is just as manifest as the vagueness and indistinctness I have been pointing out. Why are infancy and coverture to be given in evidence under the general issue, while other defences of a similar description must be pleaded specially, as the statute of limitations always, and leave and license in trespass? If it is right that specific defences, of which your general plea gives your opponent no notice, should be couched under that plea, why should you be compelled to give notice of other averments before being suffered to prove them? Why do you, in one case, multiply pleas, which, in the other, your own practice declares to be unnecessary? One or other course, the vague or the definite, the prolix or the concise, may be fitting: both cannot be right. Nay, there is often an option given as to the same thing; infancy, coverture, release, accord, and satisfaction, and others, may either be given under the general issue in assumpsit, or pleaded. Why, this choice amounts to no rule at all! If a ground of defence is ever to be pleaded specially, why not always?
3. Akin to this inconsistency of principle is the variety of repugnant counts and pleas allowed in all cases whatever. Where there are ten different ways of stating a defence, and all of them are employed, it is hardly possible that any three of them can be true; at the same time Edition: current; Page: [39] their variety tends to prevent both the opposite party and the court from knowing the real question to be tried. Yet this practice is generally resorted to, because neither party knows accurately what course his opponent may take; each, therefore, throws his drag-net over the whole ground, in hopes to avail himself of every thing which cannot escape through its meshes. Take the case of debt on bond. The first plea in such an action, almost as a matter of course, is the general issue, non est factum, whereby the defendant denies that it is his deed; the second as usual is, solvit ad diem—he paid it on the day mentioned in the bond, a circumstance not very likely to happen, if it be not his deed; the third is solvit post diem—he paid it after the day; a thing equally unlikely to happen, if it be not his bond, or if he paid it when due; and a fourth often is, a general release. What can the plaintiff learn from a statement in which the defendant first asserts that he never executed the deed, and next that he not only executed it, but has moreover paid it off? Where pleas are consistent with each other, it may be well to let them be pleaded in unlimited abundance: where they are not only not consistent, but absolutely destructive of each other, it would be a good rule to establish that such pleas should not be put together upon the record, at least without some previous discussion and leave obtained. The grounds of action are often stated with almost as great inconsistency, almost always with greater multiplicity in the declaration. I recollect that at York, many years ago, it was my duty, as junior counsel, to open the pleadings in an action brought upon a wager which had been laid upon the life of the Emperor Napoleon. I stated to the jury in the usual way that the defendant, in consideration of one hundred guineas, agreed to pay the plaintiff a guinea a day during the life of one Napoleon Bonaparte, and so forth, alleging the breach. Thus far all was well, and the audience were not disturbed; but there was not much gravity among them when I went on to state the second count, averring another wager on the life of “one other Napoleon Bonaparte;” and indeed, though one in those days was quite enough for the rest of the world, two did not satisfy the pleader, who made mention of a third and a fourth Napoleon.’*

We give the following as evidence from the Second Report of Commissioners on Courts of Common Law:—

‘The multiplication of counts and pleas has long been considered as one of the chief abuses in the system of pleading. Though in other respects the prolixity of allegation once prevalent has been materially retrenched, this particular kind of redundance has never, perhaps, prevailed more remarkably than at the present day. Records, containing from ten to fifteen special counts or pleas, are by no means rare, and fail to excite remark. Of these, the greater proportion, and frequently the whole, relate to the same substantial cause of action or defence. They are merely different expositions of the same case, and expositions of it often inconsistent with each other. The practice is productive of great and various inconveniences. One of the most obvious is its tendency Edition: current; Page: [40] to increase the expense of litigation. The length of a count or plea is very uncertain, but cannot be stated on an average at less than four law folios, and at that length, the addition of each count or plea is an addition of four shillings to the taxed costs on the draft. The increased expense is also to be taken into the account which attends the making copies to be kept and sent into the country, the making up of the issue, the paper books, the engrossments on parchment, and court fees thereon, and the necessary increase in the length of the brief and the amount of fees to counsel. There are other consequences, however, of the practice, even more injurious in our opinion, than its effects on the bill of costs. It often leads to such bulky and intricate combinations of statement, as to present the case to the judge and jury in a form of considerable complexity; and is apt, therefore, to embarrass and protract the trial, and occasionally leads to ultimate confusion and mistake in the administration of justice. The inconvenience last mentioned is more particularly felt, when, to a declaration consisting of various counts, the pleading happens to be special; for in that case the pleas also, like the counts to which they are pleaded, are often framed in various forms, and the intricacy of the whole record proportionably increased. The practice, therefore, of multiplying counts and pleas presents one of the greatest obstacles to a more extended use of special pleading—a system, the great advantage of which we shall have occasion, in the course of this report, to explain and enforce.
The practice in question appears at first sight no less strange than objectionable. To allow the plaintiff or defendant to state his case in ten or fifteen different ways, more especially if the statements be inconsistent, is a custom, the reasonableness of which is not readily perceived, which is peculiar perhaps to our own system of judicature, and which seems to have been unknown even in that system at a former period. With respect to pleas, indeed, it is certain that the practice is not older than the 4 Anne, c. 16; and though it has been of much longer duration with respect to counts, yet the precedents from the time of Queen Elizabeth to that of King William and Queen Mary, show, that, in the use of several counts, the pleader was at that period incomparably more sparing than at present; and the still existing rule which requires each count always to set forth a cause of action ostensibly different from the preceding (even when in fact the same) combines with other reasons in support of the opinion that at an antecedent era one count only upon each cause of action was allowed. The present variety of statement, however, is not without sufficient motive, nor is its abolition or reform a task without difficulty. In some degree that variety may, no doubt, be attributed to the increased remuneration which the pleader or attorney obtains by lengthening the draft. But it is mainly founded on reasons of a more honest and more cogent kind. The principal of these is the state of the law on the subject of variance.
At the trial of the cause, a material variance between the allegation in the pleading, and the state of facts proved, is a fatal objection, and decides the suit in favour of the objecting party; and a variance is often considered in this technical sense as material, though to common Edition: current; Page: [41] sense it may appear to be very trifling, and though it may be wholly irrelevant to the merits of the case.
Thus, in an action for a false charge of felony, (Waller v. Mace, 2 Barn. and Ald., 756,) where the declaration stated that the defendant went before Richard Cavendish, Baron Waterpark of Waterfork, a justice of the peace, and falsely charged the plaintiff with the felony, and it appeared in evidence that the charge was made before Richard Cavendish, Baron Waterpark of Waterpark, this variance was considered as fatal, and the plaintiff was nonsuited. So in a case (Jones v. Cowley, 4 Barn. and Cress., 445) where the plaintiff brought his action on the warranty of a horse, stating the warranty to be that the horse was sound, and it appeared upon the proof that the warranty was that the horse was sound except for a kick on one of its legs, this was also held to be a ground of nonsuit, though the unsoundness which was proved, and for which the action was brought, had no relation to the leg. In another case (Shipham v. Samders, 2 East, 4) where the plaintiff brought his action on a contract to deliver goods, though he took the precaution of stating it in two different ways, viz., in one count, as a contract to deliver within fourteen days, and, in another, as a contract to deliver on the arrival of a certain ship; yet he was nonsuited, because at the trial it was proved to be a contract in the alternative, viz., to deliver within fourteen days, or on the arrival of the ship; and he had no count stating it in the alternative. The cause of action, however, was the non-delivery of the goods after the expiration of the fourteen days, and also after the arrival of the vessel, so that the variance was wholly immaterial to the real merits of the case. This kind of objection is naturally looked out for by a party whose case has no foundation on the merits, and is consequently of very frequent occurrence; so that, notwithstanding the protection from it, afforded (as will presently be explained) by the use of several counts and pleas, it is one of the most frequent sources of miscarriage in the suit.’*

The following quotation, from the same authority, relates to the mode of pleading by the general issue:—

‘One of the most important questions which has presented itself in the course of our inquiries, is, whether it is expedient to continue to any, and to what extent, the use of that kind of plea denominated the General Issue. Under this plea, which is in its shape a summary form of denial of the allegations in the declaration, or some principal part of them, a defendant is at present allowed, in certain actions, to put the plaintiff to the proof of everything alleged in the declaration, and in some, not only to do this, but at the same time to prove in his own defence, almost any kind of matter in confession and avoidance; that is, matter which, admitting the truth of the plaintiff’s allegations, tends to repel or obviate their effect. On the other hand, there are some kinds of action in which, if the defence consists of any matter in confession and avoidance, it must be specially pleaded, and cannot be admitted in proof under the general Edition: current; Page: [42] issue; and there are others in which, properly speaking, there is no general issue, and in which all the pleading may be considered as special.
That the present state of the practice on this subject requires alteration seems to be universally felt; but with respect to the kind of alteration required, the views taken by different persons are surprisingly dissimilar; one set of opinions pointing to the restriction of the general issue, and another to its wider application, and to a correspondent extinguishment of special pleading. It will be found, however, on reference to the written communications addressed to us, that there is a decided preponderance of authority in favour of the former course; and we do not hesitate to declare our own strong conviction that it is the right one, and that its adoption would be attended with highly beneficial results.
We conceive that considerable misapprehension popularly prevails upon the subject of special pleading. That system was characterised, no doubt, at former periods of our legal history, by a tendency to prolix and tautologous allegation, an excessive subtlety, and an overstrained observance of form; and, notwithstanding material modern improvements, it still exhibits too much of the same qualities. These, its disadvantages, are prominent and well understood; its recommendations are, perhaps, less obvious, but, when explained, cannot fail to be recognized as of far superior weight. Special pleading, considered in its principle, is a valuable forensic invention peculiar to the common law of England, by the effect of which, the precise point in controversy between the parties is developed, and presented in a shape fit for decision. If that point is found to consist of matter of fact, the parties are thus apprised of the exact nature of the question to be decided by the jury, and are enabled to prepare their proofs with proportionate precision. If, on the other hand, it turns out to be matter of law, they have the means of immediately obtaining the decision of the cause, without the expense and trouble of a trial—by demurrer,—that is, by referring the legal question, so evolved, to the determination of the judges.
But where, instead of special pleading, the general issue is used, and, under it, the defendant is allowed to bring forward matters in confession and avoidance, these benefits are lost. Consisting, as that plea does, of a mere summary denial of the case stated by the plaintiff, and giving no notice of any defensive allegation on which the defendant means to rely, it sends the whole case on either side to trial, without distinguishing the fact from the law, and without defining the exact question or questions of fact to be tried. It not unfrequently, therefore, happens, that the parties are taken by surprise, and find themselves opposed by some unexpected matters of defence or reply, which, from the want of timely notice, they are not in due condition to resist.
But an effect of more common, and indeed almost invariable occurrence, is the unnecessary accumulation of proof, and consequently of expense; for as nothing is admitted upon the pleadings, each party is obliged to prepare himself, as far as it is practicable, with evidence upon all the different points which the nature of the action can by possibility Edition: current; Page: [43] make it incumbent upon him to establish, though many of them may turn out to be undisputed, and many of them may be such as his adversary, if compelled to plead specially, would have thought it undesirable to dispute.
With respect to matters of law, the inconvenience experienced, though of a different kind, is not less remarkable; for when points of law arise upon the general issue, instead of being developed, by way of demurrer, for adjudication by the full court in banc, they are of necessity left to the decision of the single judge before whom the cause is tried; and their decision, upon his sole authority, deprived as he generally is of the advantage of any previous intimation of the matters to be argued, and unable to refer to books, is often found to be unsatisfactory and inconclusive. It may even happen (and that is not an unfrequent occurrence) that the controversy, under this form of plea, turns entirely upon matter of law, there being no fact really in dispute; and, in that case, the mode of decision by jury is not only defective but misplaced, and the trial might have been spared altogether, if the parties had proceeded by the way of special pleading, and raised the question upon demurrer.
Another ill consequence attendant upon the general issue is, that as the true point for decision has not been evolved in the pleading, it becomes the business of the judge to extract it from the proofs and allegations before him, to sever correctly the law from the fact of the case, and again, the facts admitted, from those in controversy, and to present the latter in a distinct shape to the jury for their consideration; an analysis which the rapidity and tumult of a trial at Nisi Prius renders extremely difficult, and which is often defectively conducted.
Of the state of things here explained, it is the natural effect that when the general issue is pleaded, the trial fails, in numerous instances, to accomplish the purposes of justice, or even to terminate the legal dispute, and is followed by the application of the defeated party to the full court in banc, for a new trial. This proceeding involves the necessity of recapitulating, for the information of that court, the whole of what passed vivâ voce at Nisi Prius, of which there is no admissible report, except that of the presiding judge, upon whose alleged error in point of law the application most commonly is founded. The motion for a new trial is, for this reason, beset with peculiar difficulties; the effect of which is, that it ultimately fails in many cases (as there is reason to apprehend) where in justice it ought to succeed, and succeeds in many cases where there is in reality no sufficient ground for the application. It may be added that, even when successful, it gives no redress, beyond that of awarding a new and expensive inquiry upon the matter of fact; and that with respect to the matters of law, of which it may involve the discussion, they are less distinctly and less satisfactorily decided, upon the motion for a new trial, than when raised by special pleading, and so brought before the court in the first instance, by way of demurrer, for determination.
But these considerations give an inadequate idea of the extent of the inconvenience now produced by the great and growing frequency of the Edition: current; Page: [44] motions in question. Indeed we know of no existing abuse of which the influence is so wide, and the pressure so intolerable. They have in a considerable degree impaired the value of a verdict, which, according to the ancient and true principle of law, was of a final and conclusive character, but is now in so many instances subjected to the revision of the court in banc, and with so much facility set aside, that the party in whose favour the opinion of the jury is declared has comparatively little reason to rely on the permanency of the advantage he has obtained. He too often finds that it is but one successful struggle in an arduous and expensive contest, which is to end at last in defeat. But an effect still more serious is the enormous extent to which this branch of practice has encroached upon those portions of the public time properly destined to other employment. As an illustration of this, we may refer to returns received from the King’s Bench and Common Pleas, by which it appears that in Michaelmas Term 1829, ninety-nine motions for new trials were made in the former court, and forty-nine in the latter; that in the King’s Bench rules nisi were granted upon fifty-three of these applications, and not more than four rules for new trials ultimately disposed of in the course of the term; and that in the Common Pleas there were thirty-nine rules nisi granted, of which ten only were disposed of. To such accumulations addition of course is made in each succeeding term; and were it not for the assistance obtained from the sitting of the three judges out of term (a jurisdiction which, in other respects, has appeared to us objectionable, and to require abolition), the result, as far as regards the Court of King’s Bench, would be a total obstruction of the current of ordinary business, by the growing masses of arrears upon motions for new trials. The tendency of the general issue to give occasion for such applications, we have already attempted to explain; and we have no hesitation, therefore, in attributing to the use of that plea the far greater part of the evils to which we have thought it our duty to advert, as connected with motions of that description. We think, too, that its disuse would supply the only practicable and effective remedy.
Other inconveniences, though certainly of less moment, result from that method of pleading. It often happens that points of law, arising at the trial, receive no decision from the judge, but are reserved by him for the opinion of the Court in banc; or with a view to a more distinct and solemn argument before that Court, the facts proved are thrown, by consent of parties, into the form of a special case. Neither of these methods is comparable, in point of certainty, of dispatch, or of cheapness, with that which is afforded by demurrer; and their substitution for the latter operates, like the motion for a new trial, though in a less degree, to the prejudice of both the parties, and to the delay of public business.’*

There is an important communication from Sir William Draper Best, L.C.J., in the Appendix to the same Report, where he proposes vivâ voce examination of the parties as a Edition: current; Page: [45] remedy against the defects of written pleadings. If he had recommended this examination to take place before the judge, it would have corresponded in a great degree with our idea of what pleading ought to be.

‘Assignees of bankrupts are now permitted to summon any persons against whom they bring actions before the commissioners of bankrupts, and examine them as often as they please. Assignees have often extracted, by such examinations, sufficient evidence to support their actions. If it is fit that assignees of bankrupts should be allowed to examine those whom they sue, it is equally fit that other plaintiffs should have the same privilege. And if plaintiffs are permitted to examine defendants, the latter should be allowed to examine plaintiffs. An account on the oath of any party to a cause may be obtained by a bill of discovery. This proves that it is not contrary to equity to examine parties against themselves. The bill of discovery is expensive, dilatory, and often useless. I have heard it said that an equity draftsman must be a great bungler if he cannot save his client from perjury, and yet contrive that his answer shall be of no use to the party who calls for it. To get at truth, the examinant must be required to answer promptly: he must answer for himself, and not have the assistance of another person to find words for him. The examinant’ (qu. examiner?) ‘must have the opportunity of putting such further questions as the answers of the examinant suggest. Neither an answer in chancery, nor an examination on interrogatories, will answer all these purposes. I propose, that as soon as any action be brought (even before appearance) either party to a cause may examine on oath the other, before a barrister of five years’ standing; or if the parties live more than ten miles from any such barrister, before any attorney who has practised five years, that shall be appointed by the Chief Justice of the court in which the cause is depending. The words used by the examinant should be taken down by the person before whom such witness is examined; and the examination so taken be returned to the Court. No questions should be put to any party, which cannot be put to a witness in court, or which a defendant in equity cannot be compelled to answer. The person before whom the examination is taken should be sworn to take the evidence fairly, and to report it correctly. After such examinations, in a great number of cases very few, if any, witnesses will be required. The whole of the case of each party will be fully disclosed, and nothing will remain for juries to do but to assess damages. In cases which depend on circumstances of which the parties have no positive knowledge, and which are to be proved by witnesses, the parties will, from these examinations, discover the nature of these circumstances, and each side will come prepared to make the best of their respective cases. There will remain no pretence for complaining of surprise. Some persons think that parties should not know each other’s cases. Parties know each other’s cases in the trial of issues from Chancery; and when causes are tried a second time, these cases are more easily and satisfactorily tried than any other. Much more mischief is to be apprehended from surprise than from the Edition: current; Page: [46] fullest knowledge of a cause. When each party is equally prepared, no tampering with witnesses—no trick will defeat truth. There will be no occasion to prove instruments, the execution of which is admitted by the party against whom they are to be used, unless he accompanies his admission by the suggestion of something that tends to impeach the validity of the instrument offered in evidence. Attesting witnesses are now brought from the most distant parts of the kingdom to prove instruments, the due execution of which there is not the least pretence for disputing.
There are parties who, ignorant of the answer their opponents have to give, think they have good cases. There are some who know that if the whole truth can be got at, they have no chance of success, but persevere in litigation, in the hope that their adversaries will not discover their weakness, or will not be able to take advantage of it for want of proof; others are misled by their attornies, who afterwards excuse themselves from advising their clients to proceed by protesting that their clients deceived them. These are the ways in which parties deceive themselves, or are deceived to their own ruin, and sometimes the ruin of their unfortunate opponents. The examination of the parties will dispel these delusions; the clients will know the insufficiency of their cases, and that their adversaries are prepared to take advantage of it. Attornies will not be able to screen their characters from the reproach of having given bad advice, by the pretence of not knowing the defects of the cases they have undertaken. I am persuaded that these examinations will stop many cases, and prevent much misery.’*

It is astonishing that, in all these observations of professional men, both on the defects in the English mode of ascertaining the point in dispute, and on the remedies, to not one does it seem to have occurred, that this is a business for the judge,—that it is one great portion of the judicial inquiry,—that unless this part of the inquiry is well performed, nothing else can be well performed,—that there is no chance of its being habitually well performed, if it is not performed by the judge,—and that collateral advantages of the greatest importance result from its being made an essential part of the duty of the judge.
This is a remarkable fact, in evidence of the effect which practice produces on the minds of practising men. They look at what is. That is their habit; and to such a degree of strength is it brought, that they almost lose the power of adverting to anything else. English lawyers have never seen that this has been any part of the business of the judge; it is passed over by them, consequently, as a thing which does not require his interference, and which is fitly performed without him. To us it appears to be so completely the guiding principle of a good procedure, and so necessarily to bring along Edition: current; Page: [47] with it every thing else which is good, that we shall treat very summarily the other parts of procedure.
All the curious learning, and all the vexatious practice connected with the subjects of writs and actions, is discarded at once, if this rational mode of pleading is adopted. A notice to the defendant when his presence is wanted, is all that is necessary to bring the whole case into court. And the dealings of the judge with the parties does all the rest, till the second part of the judicial inquiry commences,—that is, the trial, or the determining, by evidence, the point of fact or of law, on which the question of right is found by the judge to depend.
Of course, the object of a good procedure is, that justice may be attained with the greatest certainty, and at the least expense. One of the great causes of expense is the attendance of witnesses. Every thing, then, should be done to prevent the attendance of unnecessary witnesses. This important object may be attained completely, if the grand instrument of vivâ voce pleading is used.
No witnesses should be allowed to be summoned but under the fiat of the judge. Of course, he will allow none to be summoned but those who can speak to the issue—to the point which determines the question. He acquires that requisite knowledge by interrogation of the parties. The party on whom the burthen of proof devolves, is desired to state what witnesses he wants to be summoned. He is then made to explain with respect to each of them, to what it is that he expects his evidence to go; and only if it appears that such evidence will be useful, does the judge allow the presence of the witness to be required. The defendant, in like manner, is made to show what it is which he expects each of his witnesses to do in meeting such proof; and, upon such showing, the judge in like manner determines which of them shall be required to attend.
On the mode of taking the evidence we think it unnecessary to enlarge. The subject, as regards evidence from all its sources, has been treated with the greatest fullness and efficiency by Mr. Bentham, and we could only repeat what he has explained. There are, however, two of the points on which he has enlarged, to which, on account of their vast importance, we think it necessary to call the attention of our readers.
Except in cases of necessity, all evidence should be delivered vivâ voce in open court, and fully subject to cross-examination. This is the most efficient of all securities for truth in testimony; and yet it is deplorable to learn to what an extent English law, which admits the principle, allows it to be departed from in Edition: current; Page: [48] practice; and the most important points to be decided on evidence unnecessarily deprived of this important security, and therefore of far inferior value.
One of the plainest precepts of common sense is, that evidence to the point in question should be sought from every source from which it is likely to be obtained. All systems of law have run into the most incredible absurdities on this subject, and not less than any of them the English law: its rules about the exclusion of evidence are such, that they would seem to have been drawn up by men whose object it was that the truth should not be disclosed. Reason immediately concurs in the conclusion, that no evidence should be disallowed which bears upon the point, and of which the attainment is not so difficult as to countervail the use. We refer to Mr. Bentham for the triumphant establishment of this great practical maxim. His remarks on the wretched pretences on which the rules of exclusion have been defended, deserve to be pointed out as one of the happiest specimens of the refutation and exposure of interested nonsense.
When the point of fact or of law on which the question of right depends has been determined, nothing remains but to pronounce the decree and give it execution. The means of giving effect to the award of the judge are so simple and obvious, that they cannot escape the notice of any man whose real desire it is that the best means of attaining the object should be employed. It is not therefore our intention to lengthen this article by the needless labour of pointing them out.
Such is the compass of law reform. It is all contained in three essential particulars:—expressing the law as it ought to be expressed; employing judges to do the judicial business of the country where they can do it to most advantage; prescribing to them the mode of inquiry which leads with most certainty, and least trouble, delay, and expense, to the knowledge of the truth.
That they are simple means, that they are efficient means, and that all other means are bad in comparison, is among the clearest and most infallible of the deductions of common sense.
It is very evident, however, that they must be conjoined, in order to the attainment of the end to which they are directed. No one, and no two of them, without the other, will answer our expectation.
Suppose we have the law expressed, as it ought to be expressed; but judges employed and distributed in the barbarous and irrational manner in which the men doing judges’ work in Edition: current; Page: [49] England are distributed and controlled, and doing it with the detestable procedure which they use; it cannot be doubted that the improved expression of a law administered by such instruments would go a very little way towards affording us the unspeakable benefits of good judicature. The delay, the expense, and even the uncertainty, would be very little diminished.
Again, suppose we had judges well supplied and placed, both for the original and appellate jurisdiction, but acting through an abominable procedure, and with a law abominably expressed, it is obvious under what disadvantages these judges would necessarily act, and to what an extent they would be hindered from affording to the community the benefit of a good administration of justice.
As these three things, had in perfection, are indispensable for a good administration of justice, it is obvious what must be the effect of trying to do without them, by making repairs on the despicable instruments which exist. Repair them as long as you please, you will have nothing but a pair of Sir John Cutler’s stockings after all. Touch this thing or the other thing in your ill-contrived judicial establishment, it is an ill-contrived judicial establishment still. Rectify some of the vices of your system of written pleadings, it is a system of written pleadings still, and thoroughly ill-adapted to the end we desire to attain. In regard to codification, doing this piecemeal is something like a caricature of reason. If a mass of ideas, all in disorder, are to be methodized so that they may be expressed with the greatest brevity and accuracy, you must take them all together; you cannot detach a portion, and say, we will order these; because the order proper for them depends upon the order which is proper for all the rest.
We do not, however, though we think this a most important principle, undervalue the efforts of those who have pushed the work of codification in a less perfect manner. They saw that in the benighted state of mind of those on whom the decision still depended, the proposition to systematize and accurately express the whole law would be regarded as something frantic, while that of working upon a part would at any rate obtain a hearing. That hearing was, at all events, a good thing. It tended to familiarize to all men’s minds the subject. It tended to make them acquainted with the reasons for and the reasons against codification; the clearness and cogency of the one, the miserable imbecility of the other. This process happily is going on; and we expect shortly to hear a call for general and comprehensive codification, as irresistible as that which has given us, at last, a commencement of parliamentary reform.
Edition: current; Page: [50]
We shall, probably, be asked, how we would introduce this tripartite reform, no part of which will act well in the absence of any other?—and this we are very willing to declare. We would make all the requisite preparations. We would have the law codified to the reasonable satisfaction of those who are competent judges of such a work. We would have the judicial districts of the several judges of original jurisdiction properly marked out; and the judges, both original and appellate, carefully selected and appointed. We would also have the proper rules for settling the issue by the judge, under the interrogation of parties, and for conducting the proof of the issue, settled with the utmost care, and prescribed. We would then introduce the reform entire and at once, and without any apprehension of inconvenience for a moment. Every judge would be at his post, with an intelligible book of the law for his guidance; and with only the ordinary portion of good sense, to develope the allegations presented to him, and an honest desire to do his duty, he would not often go wrong; because his path would be darkened neither by a mysterious law, nor a mysterious procedure. The people would find the redress of their wrongs offered to each of them at his door, without delay and without expense; and every man would congratulate both himself and his neighbours upon so great and happy a change in their situation.
It is often asked, as an objection to this reform of the judicial establishment where would you find a sufficient number of qualified men to act as judges? But this is a question very easily answered. The apprehension of difficulty arises from a confusion of ideas. The idea of the old technical system springs up; and, along with it, the idea of the men who, by a life of labour, have mastered the difficulties of some part of it. A great number of such men there would be some difficulty in finding. But there is no need of them. Our book of law is a plain book: and our system of procedure is a plain course, the dictate of common sense in every step of it. A very short apprenticeship would qualify any well-educated man of ordinary understanding to be a good judge in such circumstances.
The chief demand for high qualifications would be in the judges of appeal; but they would not be so numerous as to make it difficult to find men of the highest qualifications for their important and elevated situation.
The only part of the preparation, which would require time, would be the codification of the law; that is (be it always carefully remembered) putting it into good order and good expression. Here the quantity of the labour is great; and it cannot Edition: current; Page: [51] be divided. The law cannot be separated into parcels, one part given to one man, another to another, to codify. The marshalling a mass of ideas in disorder is essentially the work of one mind. One mind must survey the whole, to be qualified to say where every part of a confused mass should be located, in order to make it part of an organized and systematic whole.
It is very evident, however, that in order to afford the best chance for having the work well performed, more minds than one should be applied to it. This might be done by the offer of premiums. To any man who produces a code, adequate reward should be insured. A very high reward should be held out to him whose production, on the comparative trial, is the one approved. But to induce men to devote a number of their years to hard labour, something more than the mere chance of a reward must be afforded. The men who are most likely to be efficient workmen will be found to be without independent incomes; and they must be supported while the work is going on. Some arrangements would be necessary (the reward being high) to limit the number of applicants admitted, and to guard against fraud; but these smaller matters present no painsworthy difficulty, and will be thought of time enough, when the public voice is prepared to call imperatively for this essential instrument of a people’s good. Whether this call will come at a less or at a greater distance of time, it is impossible to foresee. The work will certainly be performed, whenever we have a House of Commons which truly represents the people; that is, a House of Commons chosen by the people, not nominally, as, to a great degree, it is at present, but actually, and in truth; when, and not before, we shall have a House of Commons whose thoughts will be devoted to the public weal.
P. Q.

Edition: current; Page: [283]

Art. I.: ARISTOCRACY.
THE advocates of aristocracy—who are numerous, not without abilities, and of whom there will be good supply for some time to come—labour strenuously to confound inequalities of fortune with aristocratical privileges. And no wonder they do; for all the plausibility of their sophisms is derived from this expedient. Were they obliged to speak of aristocratical privilege, truly, as it is—power held by a certain narrow class to do with the rest of the community what they please—they would be treated with the scorn, which a pretension so impudent and hostile deserves. While allowed, however, to practise with the forked tongue, and talk of inequality of fortune and aristocratical privileges as the same, they can hold up the advantages accruing from inequality of fortune, and by a juggle of language make them pass for advantages of aristocracy.
This is the course which must always be pursued when a bad thing is to be vindicated. The praises of some other thing, which is good, are cunningly transferred to the thing which is bad. When the object is to defend a useless and most expensive ecclesiastical establishment, take notice that the praises of religion are transferred to it. The two ideas—that of religion in all its excellence, and that of an ecclesiastical establishment, however bad—are blended together by artful language, and so closely associated, that ordinary minds find it difficult to disjoin them. When this association of ideas is pretty generally formed, the ecclesiastical sophists proceed at their case. Their business is only to declaim and abuse:—‘Base men! would you destroy religion?’ Or, if in Ireland, ‘Base men! would you destroy Protestantism?’ When all the while there is no question about either religion or Protestantism, but only about an ecclesiastical establishment which is inimical to both.
Take another example, in the abuses of government. They who desire to maintain in existence the causes of evil strive to confound them with the causes of good; and by taking them Edition: current; Page: [284] in the lump, apply to the causes of evil the praise which belongs to the causes of good. We are told of the advantages of the constitution: that is, in their sophistical language, the benefits of government in the aggregate. Well, we are as sensible of the benefits of government as they are; but we will not allow them to transfer the credit of those benefits to things which are not the causes of them, but the reverse—causes of evil, not of benefit. They may compliment causes of evil with the name of part of the constitution, as long as they please; we shall not be inclined to suffer them any more on that account. Those parts of the constitution which we hold sacred are the causes of good. By casting off the things which are the causes of evil, we think we are doing service to the constitution, in the only sense in which it deserves a particle of our respect.
Reformers are far from thinking evil of inequalities of fortune: on the contrary, they esteem them a necessary consequence of things which are so good, that society itself, and all the happiness of human beings, depend upon them: a consequence of those laws whence the generation and augmentation of property proceeds. That the prosperity of nations may advance, there must exist motives to accumulate. But these motives will operate on some men more, on some less, on some not at all. There will be different degrees, therefore, of accumulation:—and this is the origin of all inequality of property. Nor can the tendency to it be checked, were it desirable to do so, without checking accumulation, and all the advantages which are to be derived from it.
But, abstracting from the consideration that we cannot have other things which are good for us in the highest degree, without having inequalities of fortune along with them, we consider inequalities of fortune as themselves good—the cause of most admirable effects. To have men of high intellectual attainments, we must have men who have their time at their command: not under the necessity of spending it wholly, or in greater part, in providing the means of subsistence:—in other words, we must have men of independent incomes. And that we may have this happy effect, in the desirable degree, we must have them not few in number; we must have them a more than inconsiderable proportion of the population. Where the only men who are in circumstances to devote themselves to intellectual pursuits are few in number, there is not sufficient stimulus. There must be a public capable of appreciating such attainments, sufficiently numerous to give a weight to their esteem, before a motive can be generated sufficiently strong to induce any considerable number of men to take the Edition: current; Page: [285] trouble, long and laborious, of making themselves knowing and wise.
Besides this first and all-important effect, a class of men possessing leisure is absolutely necessary for cultivating the elegancies of life. This cannot be expected from men absorbed in the labours and cares of earning a subsistence. A society composed of such men would be necessarily coarse, and would have a tendency to grow more and more so: a taste even for cleanliness and neatness would be apt to be lost among them. But the laborious classes are prone to the imitation of those who are in circumstances above them; and when they see elegance, are fully capable of discerning its superiority to that which is coarse; they are refined by imitation; and it is of prodigious importance to have in each community a standard of behaviour to which they may look up; and even of household accommodation, which they may strive to imitate—if not in the costliness of the materials, at least in the style of the arrangement, and even the beauty of the forms.

Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes
Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.

And even to be conversant with the refinements of life, the simple, unaffected, and true, is a kind of drawing into the path of virtue.
But while we thus value the advantages of inequality of fortune, we must say a word for the prevention of a common, but grievous mistake. They are the natural inequalities of fortune, not the unnatural, to which all these advantages are attached. By the natural inequalities of fortune, we mean those which are the result of the natural laws of accumulation; not those which are the result of unnatural restraint put upon the natural laws of distribution—that a man shall not leave his property to whom he will, or that it shall not go in equal portions to those whose proximity of relation to him is the same. The inequalities which are owed to this source are mischievous in every way—restraining the salutary effects which flow from inequalities of the natural kind, and operating otherwise as a disease in the body politic.
A few reflections will make this evident; and it is a truth which deserves our most profound attention.
The first effect of those artificially-made, unnatural inequalities, is to raise up a small number of enormous fortunes, which stand by themselves, and constitute a little class. We have only to think of the situation of the persons in whom those masses of property, which cannot be used for any useful purpose, Edition: current; Page: [286] are vested; and the influences which thence act upon them, at every stage of their lives.
What motive have they to cultivate the intellectual virtues? or any other virtues? Their business is pleasure. Distinction is created for them, by the command which they have over the things which all men desire.
Not acquiring the intellectual virtues, it is their interest to profess contempt for them, and to the utmost of their power to prevent the esteem of them from rising in the community. They hate men of intellect, and drive them away. Observe the character of those whom, not distinguished by the same gifts of fortune with themselves, our English nobility raise, as they term it, to their familiarity. Have men of intellectual superiority been much found among them in any age? The men whom they delight to honour are rhymesters, story-makers, pretenders to literature but true parasites, singers, fiddlers, dancers, painters, joke-crackers, and buffoons.
The effect of this is very great in keeping down the value of intellectual acquirements in the nation—lessening the motive to the acquisition of them, and diminishing the number of those who reach them; for this class have the power of setting the fashion, and their example forms the general taste.
This is one deplorable effect of these artificially-created and unnatural inequalities of fortune;—that they keep down the standard of intellectual excellence in the nation; in which they are potently assisted by the clergy of a vicious establishment, to whom the prospect of growing intellect in the community is despair.
Nor is their influence less potent in preventing the general diffusion of a taste for the elegancies of life. The distinction of men overflowing to excess with wealth is not to have beautiful things, but costly. A passion for running after the costly things, in preference to the beautiful, is created and diffused; the universal emulation is to put forth the gaudy signs of being rich, to the ruin of many of those who enter into this barbarie competition. Cost and elegance becoming synonymous terms, the very thought of seeking for elegance—which in this sense they cannot afford—is extinguished in the breasts of those among whom it is of most importance that the taste of real elegance should be diffused: because from them it descends with greatest ease to the body of the population.
It would be very instructive to illustrate this observation in detail, and to show how the operation of large fortunes tends to the corruption of taste, in everything to which the word elegance is with propriety applied. But we must confine ourselves to a few instances.
Edition: current; Page: [287]
To begin with architecture, which is one of the noblest of the fine arts, and of which the creations, when really tasteful, have the power of calling up such a train of interesting associations as constitute some of the highest of the pleasures of imagination. By the strength and durability of their materials, uniting one age with another—by the charms of proportion, and the superaddition of appropriate and harmonious beauties to the parts essential to the use for which the building is designed—in the ornaments of which, for every purpose of taste, the idea of fitness, or the useful, must always predominate—trains of the most agreeable ideas are incessantly renewed; and with this great advantage, that the creations of architecture are of necessity public; and the enjoyment of them, like the light of day, is as much the property of the poor as of the rich.
The unmanly and frivolous state of mind which characterizes a class overloaded with wealth has actually extinguished architecture among us as one of the fine arts. It has become a low trade of mimicry, or rather apery—misjudging, misapplying—forming incongruous monsters, revolting to good sense as well as to good taste. Who but people whose taste is gone would have thought of erecting, as ornamental, a triumphal arch, in an age, and a country, in which there are no triumphal processions, and in which the reality of that barbarous and inhuman exhibition would not be endured? A man of taste would as soon think of ornamenting his drawing-room with the thumb-screws and bootikins with which the hierarchical churchmen of Scotland tortured the Presbyterians, as to ornament his street with a triumphal arch!—not to mention the bright idea of setting it astride, not a public street, through which only would a triumphal procession pass, but a by-path, leading to a private dwelling.
We have also some beautiful specimens of the rich man’s taste, in gates. A gate is an opening through the inclosure of an inclosed space. The gate of a walled city is an opening into the city through its wall;—a gate into a park or a field is an opening through the fence of the park or the field, into the field. But it is evident that there is no sense in a gate higher or more elaborate than the fence, of whatever sort it be, through which it affords admission. Take, then, as a specimen of congruity, proportion, or good sense, the extraordinary piece of stone and mortar at Hyde Park Corner, which lets people into a green field, through a paling four feet high;—and, as another specimen, the thing set before the palace at Buckingham Gate, standing totally detached from the building, like a pillar of Edition: current; Page: [288] salt, and put there it should seem only (by the superiority of its material) to make the palace look dirty and mean.
But the thing which deserves most reprobation is the despicable mimicry, substituted for ornament, in the ordinary class of expensive buildings. Every idea of appropriate ornament seems to be abandoned, in order to stick about them the appurtenances of a Grecian temple. The men of Greece did what men of sense and taste will always do—they considered what were the substantial, indispensable parts of their buildings; to these they endeavoured to superadd such shapes, proportions, and decorations as harmonized with them. The essential parts of Grecian buildings, particularly temples, of which almost solely any specimens have remained for our inspection, were pillars, and the roof which they were placed to support. The chief thing which admitted of ornament here were the pillars. What grace and beauty the Grecian architects contrived to bestow upon them is known to all. The substantial, indispensable parts of buildings in our climate are solid walls, with holes cut in them for doors and windows. The study of our architects should, therefore, have been, the ornaments which could be applied to solid walls, windows, and doors—as well by variety and grace of form, as by other congruous decorations. But our architects, under guidance of the wealthy man’s taste, have abandoned the very thought of this, and have dreamed of nothing but giving us the supports of a Grecian roof, where all roofs are otherwise supported: exhibiting mere affectation, and the utmost barrenness of invention. What an image is presented to a man of cultivated taste, when he sees that which is the appropriate support of the roof of an open building stuck into the heart of a solid wall, or standing a little space before it, with something laid on its top, to make a mock show that it has got something to do!
Music, fortunately, it has not been in the power of our rich man’s taste to spoil. It is not of home growth. The man of wealth is obliged to take it as it is made for him, in places more favourable to the wholesome cultivation of it; and one of his affectations is to profess a delight in it, which is beyond both truth and reason. In this, too, his conduct is very unfavourable to the progress of taste. The profession of the intense in the enjoyment of the fine arts, tends to working for the intense in the productions of them; and then truth, and nature, and all that is of fine relish in them, goes. There is a peculiarity well worth remarking in our rich man’s concern for music: he hates that the enjoyment should go down to his poorer neighbours. Yet it is obvious that this is a very desirable thing. Edition: current; Page: [289] In the first place, it is an innocent pleasure; and in so far as it exercises agreeably the vacant time of the labouring man, it is a good per se, and moreover a diversion from the pursuit of pleasures which are otherwise than innocent. But there is another effect of still greater importance. Sweet music is in unison with all the sympathetic affections of the soul, and by drawing out trains of such emotions tends to make them habitual in the mind. A really wise and beneficent legislature would reckon it a great point to cultivate a taste for music among the common people, and to afford it to them of a good kind. The conduct of our legislature, under influence of the rich man’s taste, and the churchman’s hypocrisy, is altogether its own. There never was anything like it in the world. It treats the common people as unworthy to enjoy the pleasure of music. Latterly the taste in music had so much improved, that the strolling musicians, who practise in the streets, had become no bad performers; and very tolerable music might be heard in the streets. That was the moment for declaring war against it; and now it is all but prohibited: as it is, in those only other places, where it was in the power of the common people to enjoy it—the places of cheap resort. If there was danger, as no doubt there was, of improprieties in those places of unregulated resort, what was to be done? Why, to afford the same, or better amusement, in places properly regulated.
In painting and sculpture, the taste of the man of wealth is notorious and proverbial: it is pure selfishness. His money is all lavished on old pictures—the reverse of encouragement to the making of new—and on portraits. The old pictures he carries home, where he is proud of them as signs of his wealth, and shuts them up from public inspection, which is almost their only use. Portrait-painting, and portrait-sculpture, the very lowest branches of the art, are the branches which he really encourages: so that, in the higher departments, very few attempts are made; and the art in this country is stationary, or worse. We do not, however, regard this as much of a misfortune. To the body of the population, pictures and statues can never render very valuable service: they are but poor arts; and the pleasures they give are but little connected with any of those mental states which we are interested in cultivating. The exhibition of the human form in its ideal perfection is the best thing they do; and that is something. The perfection of the female form calls up ideas of love; and of the male form, ideas of dignity, or of force. But these are states of mind which nature provides for. In telling a story, to call out the affections, the brush and the chisel are very defective: Edition: current; Page: [290] their resources are confined. Except by some hideous exhibition, as that of the Laocoontes, or Ugolino, the emotions raised are faint.
In respect of this art, there is in the behaviour of the men of wealth in this country to the rest of the community, something characteristic, and singularly worthy of attention. Under pretence of improving the taste of the people, they get the community, as often as possible, to buy certain articles, which serve exclusively for their own enjoyment; and while they are doing so, exclude the people, about whose taste they are so anxious, from the enjoyment of the beauties of nature—a source of the greatest improvement—by shutting up paths, which are the people’s right, and from which they are excluded only by the right of the stronger, or, in plain English, robbery.
We are accustomed, no doubt, to acts of rapacity on a larger scale; but there never was in degree a more profligate instance of the abuse of public money than the purchase of two Corregios the other year, by money extracted from the pockets of an overburthened population. Why did not the men of wealth, if they wanted such things—nobody else did—purchase them with their own money? The pretence that the purchase was for the good of the people, even after all our experience of impudent pretences, was astounding. Our legislators gave 11,000l. for two Correggios, and had but 20,000l. to spare for the education of the people, and could not at all relieve them from the taxes on knowledge! Oh, brave!
We come now to an art, which is of greater importance, than all the rest taken together, the art of conversation.
When a society exists, well constituted for the pursuit of intellectual attainments and of the elegancies of life, a style of social intercourse is cultivated, which whets the understanding, and improves at once the morals and the taste. Men of independent, but few enormous incomes, sufficiently numerous to form a class and a public, are obliged to seek distinction among themselves by qualities which recommend them to the respect and affection of their fellows. These are, the high qualities of the intellect, the practice of virtue, the endearing affections, and elegance of deportment in life. In the social intercourse of persons so circumstanced, the principal ambition must be to make manifest the possession of such qualities. It needs but little stretch of imagination to see the consequences. Think what a society must be, in which all that is respectable in intellect and correct in conduct is the object of display: what effusions of knowledge,—what ingenuity of discussion,—what patience with the ignorant,—what gentleness in the contest of Edition: current; Page: [291] differing opinions,—what tasteful disquisitions on the slighter ornaments of life, and what grace in the enjoyment and display of them! Social intercourse of this kind is a school of all that is grand and lovely in human nature. And where such is the style of that intercourse in the leading class—a class not separated from, but intimately mixed with, the rest of the community, the imitation of it is inevitable. The community becomes intellectual and refined. Please call to mind that this is the state of things, which a vapouring man, a needy dependent of the aristocracy, said was to tread down all that is ornamental in society “under the hoofs of a swinish multitude:” a formula which was greedily taken up by those who thought themselves made of a different clay from the “swinish multitude;” and actively made use of, till they found it would no longer do. The “swinish multitude” now know that they are a potent multitude; and they will no longer be trodden down under heels however high-born and genteel.
We have now to consider the style of social intercourse which is generated by the circumstances of a society composed of men of overgrown wealth. The distinction of these men arises from their wealth; and for the most part they seek no other distinction. This is a fruitful source of consequences. High mental qualifications, not being the cause of distinction to such men, are not possessed by them. They cannot take part in conversations where these are displayed. They therefore banish them from their society. It is voted ungenteel to be the introducer of a serious subject; and the frivolity of the conversation in the high circle is proverbial and notorious. Pope, who often hit off characteristic features with great felicity, gave a taste of aristocratic conversation, in speaking of the heads of the aristocratic circle, Kings:

————“Heard every lord declare
His noble sense of op’ras and the fair.”

The writers of books of entertainment, in verse or prose, and suited to the aristocratical taste, also men who can vent the cant of criticism, or who have got by heart and can spout flashy passages out of books, and come out occasionally with bits of knowledge or pretended knowledge, are admitted into this high society; but men of solid acquirements are not there; and the others are admitted on terms sufficiently humiliating. Mr. Moore, though one of the most favoured of the admissibles, complains that he was invited not as part of the company, but as one who could help to entertain the company. Observe also the distinctions they make; who they are whom they favour, and Edition: current; Page: [292] who they are whom they neglect; they make this man a pensioner, the other man a baronet; and the only great poet we have had since Milton, they made a gauger.
So much for what is gained in intellect by the social intercourse of high people. Let us next see what is gained in morals and refinement. Their conversation has two tones, and two only; that of mockery, and that of vehement admiration. These are the tones naturally assumed by men who think themselves superior to all others, and that upon the worst of grounds. To talk of plain things in a plain way is below the dignity of such people; the herd of mankind do that: they never talk but to show what they think of themselves; that is, with contempt of all the rest of the world; and with strained admiration of their own set, and the things which distinguish it. How prodigious their admiration of pictures!—because pictures are a luxury confined to themselves; of expensive music, for the same reason: of fine houses, fine horses, and fine dogs. The intense in admiration is in itself bad; hostile in the highest degree to the progress of taste; and the infallible criterion of a feeble understanding. When it is exclusively bestowed on frivolous objects, it is hostile to every thing that is valuable in the human mind.
But if their admiring tone is thus injurious, their disdainful tone is infinitely more so. What is desirable above all things in society is a spirit of mutual benevolence; a kindly feeling towards one another pervading the whole community. To this the tone of scorn and mockery is in direct hostility. Sympathetic kindness does not inhabit the breast along with contempt. Scorn is the natural expression of the hostile mind, where other manifestations of it are not permitted; and the indulgence of scorn is the plentiful feeder of the hostile mind. The hostile mind, therefore, is proved; and that we do not feel the more cruel effects of it, is only because they in whom it exists dare not attempt them. How deeply we are indebted to our power of striking terror! If it were not for this, we should be in the condition of the most miserable of mankind. Do you ask any further proof than the nature of the case affords? Look at Ireland.
It is thus evident, that society derives no improvement from the style of conversation and social intercourse which take place in a class of men of overgrown wealth. It is, on the other hand, the main cause why the state of intellect, of morals, and of taste, is in this country at the low point at which, in each of these respects, it remains; nor will there be any change for the better, till the influence of that class ceases to be predominant.

We have as yet considered only the effects upon society produced by a class of men possessing large fortunes, secured by special laws against distribution, without political privileges. We are now going to consider what effects are produced by the addition of political privileges.
A privilege means, a beneficial something conferred upon an individual, or class of individuals; in which the rest of the community are not permitted to share. These privileges are always some one of three things—money, or dignity, or power. The privilege is the most perfect when it combines, as it commonly does, all the three. Let us see how they, severally and respectively, work.
By the money-privilege is not meant the enjoyment of a man’s own property, whether large or small; for that belongs to every member of the community, one as much as another. It is money peculiarly allotted. The most remarkable case of this which has been actually exemplified, is that exemption from taxes which formerly was one of the privileges of the nobility in France. The sinecure places in England, once of great amount, reserved for distribution among the people of rank, is another instance of the same thing. It is not necessary to allude to more; and it is very evident what this benefit in the case of the few is composed of. It is composed of oppression to the many. There is so much taken from the many, that it may without reason be given to the few. This kind of privilege therefore is always wicked. And we must not permit the friends of this wickedness to confound it, which they like to do, with another thing which is not wicked,—the reward of important service. That is no privilege. What is so bestowed by the people is bestowed for their advantage, to secure them a supply of eminent services; and if such rewards are honestly conferred, any individual in the community, as much as another, may aspire to them.
The reflections which apply to factitious dignity are of kin to the above. We say factitious dignity, because it is that alone which has anything of privilege in it. Dignity, from its natural sources, from superior wisdom, superior beneficence, superior elegance, is open to the aspirations of all the community; even the dignity which springs from the associations we have with superior wealth, the effects of which are of a more mixed character, is not withheld from any member of the community who can manage to become rich. The dignity we mean is the dignity which is conferred by artificial distinctions; by titles, by precedencies, or any of the other contrivances, by which, apart from the natural causes of dignity, elevation is given to an individual or a class.
Edition: current; Page: [294]
A reflection is called forth upon this subject, which is of the highest importance, and which has been far too long in attracting the notice which it ought; for, out of what is this dignity to the one, or to the few, created? The answer is indisputable: the degradation of the rest. A man is elevated above others, only by making others lower than him. But if I am made lower than another man without reason, that is an injury to me: it is injustice and oppression. If another man’s pocket is filled out of mine, all the world acknowledges the oppression; but my dignity is dearer to me than my wealth. If then my dignity is lessened to augment the dignity of another man. I am injured in a more precious part.
The contrivance to degrade a community for the elevation of a few is not a happy contrivance: it is unrighteous in the purpose, and it is grievous in the effects. A degraded community is not an object of comfortable contemplation. It is a community, in which all the valuable qualities of human nature are in a lower state than they would be, if that fatal cause of depression did not exist.
When a man has attained to eminence by intellectual acquirements, by a course of beneficent conduct to his fellow-creatures, by presenting a model of what is amiable in his amusements and tastes, or, lastly, by the honourable accumulation of wealth, why should he be robbed of any portion of the dignity which those merits are calculated to confer? But this robbery he sustains, when a portion of dignity is taken from him, in order to make an addition to the dignity of somebody else: when an elevation to somebody else is created out of his degradation. The motives to the highest degree of well-doing in every line are then the most operative when this well-doing leads to the highest distinction. But the highest distinction is to be at the top. To whatever extent therefore the highest degree of well-doing is prohibited from reaching the top, to that degree the motive to it is taken away; and to that degree is the virtue of the community kept down. Then only will virtue be at the highest when the præmia virtutis are at the highest. But artificial ranks are a contrivance to prevent the præmia virtutis to be at the highest. To have a high rank, therefore, we must have a low virtue; that is part, and but a part, of the price we must pay for the article.
But of the kinds of privilege, that which consists in political powers is by far the most important. We do not mean to enter into a detailed exposition of its effects; but the particulars to which we shall advert will be allowed to deserve the most profound attention.
A privilege made of political power, must be made either of Edition: current; Page: [295] judicial power, administrative power, or legislative power. In our own country we have specimens of all the ways. The highest of all our tribunals, the tribunal of last resort, is composed of hereditary judges. The whole of the administrative power in a mass, is placed in the hands of an individual by the right of descent; which individual has also a great share of judicial power, in the exclusive right of pardoning: and as the legislative power in this country, according to the received theory of the constitution, is divided into three parts, two of the three parts exist in the shape of privilege, and only one is free.
No one disputes, that there ought to be no political power which does not exist for the good of the community; and that if in any quarter there is a single particle of it, in any shape, which is not for the good of the community, it ought to be abolished. And why?—not merely because it is superfluous; but because it is noxious. Political power is the power of commanding; and that implies the obligation of obeying. But why should I be subjected to the degradation, and the hardship, which may be to any degree, of submitting to the commands of any one, when it is for no good? Above all, why should the millions composing the community be subjected to the degradation and oppression of obeying any one’s commands, when it is for no good?
But the most weighty consideration of all yet remains to be stated. All political power which exists in the shape of privilege has a tendency to be mischievously used. This in fact is true of all political power; and therefore all wise men are for putting adequate checks upon it; that is, so ordering matters, that it shall be against the interest of those who hold it, not to make a good use of it. But all that portion of it which is allotted in the shape of privilege, is, to a certain degree, placed out of the reach of check. So far as it is so, it is most unwisely allotted. It is a power put into the hands of individuals, to be used for their own advantage, at the expense of the rest of the community.
But to set up a class or order of men, by giving them powers which they may use for their own advantage, at the expense of the rest of the community, is to set up a body of enemies to the rest of the community; for they will be sure to act like enemies; which is, to prosecute their own advantage to the utmost, regardless of the mischief they do to the rest of the community. Their constant endeavour will be, to give to their power the most extensive operation possible. It will be gilded with all sorts of false colours. Writers will be hired, some with money, some with smiles, to serve it with all the powers of sophistry. Edition: current; Page: [296] The writers who expose it, will be pursued with calumny, if there be no more direct mode of persecuting and putting them down. If there be, they will be thrown into gaols, and robbed of their property, till their ruin is consummated.
Such men full well know, that in the attainment of good government their power of serving themselves at the expense of the community will be taken away. There is nothing, therefore, which they hate with so much intensity as any approach to good government, and the men who are working with any effect towards the attainment of it. If they could poison all such men with their looks, what a heartfelt joy it would be to them! In the meantime, they do what they can with their pestilential breath: they strive to poison their reputations. The man who appears as an advocate for good government they call a wretch, who wants to destroy government and substitute anarchy; the man who exposes the abominations of an unwholesome ecclesiastical establishment they call an Atheist, and would have us believe that he is as much detested by the Almighty as he is by them.
It is very unfortunate, when a state possesses within itself a body of enemies, such as this. However, in committing the folly of giving the powers which make men the enemies of their fellow-citizens, the greatest mischief is done by giving legislative powers. So long as the legislative power is well placed, there is a remedy. The command of the legislative power is the supreme command; and it can set bounds to the exercise of all subordinate powers, and keep it within the path of utility—at least, of harmlessness. But when the power of legislation is put in the hands of those who have an interest in using it for their own purposes, the descent to evil is prone and irresistible.
In making these reflections, no man can forbear turning his thoughts to the situation of England in respect to its legislature. Nearly one-half of the legislative power is placed in the hands of men who, by the tenure on which they hold it, are of necessity converted into a body of enemies, of the kind we have just described. The great object of their dread is, as we have seen, every approach to good government. Their earnest desire, of course, is to prevent it; and the fact is—a lamentable fact assuredly—that they have it completely in their power to do so.
The existence of this power is an evil, so great, that all other grievances in the state sink into nothing compared with it. That a clear-sighted and resolute people will not always endure it, is not to be feared; but how long it may contrive to carry on its Edition: current; Page: [297] work, by fair words, and by little concessions, well-timed, it is not easy to foresee: especially so long as those who take the lead of the people in opposing them, afford them so much encouragement, by the faintness of their desire for the progress of good government, and the feebleness with which they urge even the reforms which they approve.
In the meantime, it behoves the people of this country deliberately to mature their thoughts, about the mode of meeting so great an evil, the removal of which is a matter of necessity.
In taking measures for removing evils in the machinery of government, it is good to accomplish the object (if accomplished it be, for half measures only indicate a weakness, which gives boldness to resistance, and adds to the difficulties of farther improvement)—with as little change as possible. We think that the power of the Lords to effect the incredible mischiefs, involved in their power of frustrating all schemes of improvement, might be taken away by a change very little perceptible. Let it be enacted, that if a bill, which has been passed by the House of Commons, and thrown out by the House of Lords, is renewed in the House of Commons in the next session of parliament, and passed, but again thrown out by the House of Lords, it shall, if passed a third time in the House of Commons, be law, without being sent again to the Lords.
What is put forward, as the great, and almost sole advantage of having two houses of legislation, is the security which it provides for mature deliberation; for it never can be thought by any man who has the blessing of reason, that there ought to be two authorities in a state, the one capable of barring whatever the other would do. This would be a scheme to arrest the powers of legislation, and set the whole vessel afloat without a carpenter and without a pilot. It is quite certain that if there be two authorities, one or other must have the means of prevailing in the long run. The only question then is, to which of our two houses of parliament that power should belong. And this, we believe, we may consider as a question decided. We do not suppose that the Duke of Wellington himself would pronounce for the House of Lords. Whether he would discern the consequences may be doubtful; but this he would certainly see, that it would not be submitted to. If anywhere there be two legislative assemblies—one under efficient obligations to legislate for the good of the community, the other under no obligations but to legislate for their own good—the power of prevailing in the long run, given to one or the other, involves the whole of the difference between good government and bad. Edition: current; Page: [298] The powers of legislation exercised for the good of the people is good government; the powers of legislation exercised for the good of any set of men is bad government, and is naturally carried to excess; for the good of the set can only be pursued at the expense of the community. The set are, therefore, always in fear. Fear is essentially cruel. Every thing which looks like opposition is savagely punished; terror is the security in which they confitle; and the reign of terror is theirs.
The expedient which we propose would be an effectual antidote to those evils, and would at the same time afford all the security against precipitate legislation which can be derived from a House of Lords. We are happy to see that Mr. Roebuck has taken up the idea of this expedient, and has given notice of a motion on the subject for next session of parliament. We think, however, that he has given too little time for consummating the operation. The evil will be alleged of postponing good measures; but on most of the measures on which immediate decision is of importance, there is not much likelihood of opposition between the two Houses; and on the great questions of constitutional improvement a little delay is not a great evil. Take, for example, the questions of the ballot, of shortening the duration of parliaments, of equalizing the constituencies, the interval which we propose between the first passing of a bill for any of these great objects in the House of Commons, and the time for its becoming law independently of the votes of the Lords, would not have many evil consequences, and the strong attention which would be kept fixed upon it in the meantime, would make it better understood, and more sure in its operation.
If we are told that this expedient of ours would no doubt be effectual to its end, if we could obtain it, but that to such a measure as this the Lords will never give their consent; we answer that, in a case of necessity, what cannot be obtained in one way must in another; and the probability is, that this being seen by the Lords, they will not hold out to the last. But if they do, the House of Commons have only to proceed a step farther, and declare that bills, as passed by them a certain number of times, and at certain intervals, are law. This resolution the people would had with transport, and make the enactments laws by their obedience; and from that moment the House of Lords is blotted out. The thing would be done as quietly as passing a money bill. Collision! What could they do? They would draw the sword. So do a gang of as many smugglers on the coast, but this does not alarm the nation.
We shall be told perhaps, that the judges would not recognise Edition: current; Page: [299] such laws, and would refuse to enforce them. A good many of them would have an itching that way, we have no manner of doubt; but they are men who look which way the wind blows. When the nation, and the nation’s representatives, in their determination to effect the removal of an intolerable evil, have not allowed the House of Lords to stand in the way, the judges will not be slow to infer that neither will they be allowed to stand in the way. It is easy to supply the place of judges who set themselves up against the legislature.
It has been hinted by Lord John Russell (for he is one of those who like to make themselves known by circumlocution, rather than by plain speaking, when their inclinations and those of the community are not quite in accord) that there is no occasion for any reform of the House of Peers; and in this he has been copied, which was a matter of course, by the Attorney-General. To be sure, their arguments are not calculated to make great impression. The Lords, they tell us, will grow wiser. We therefore have their word for this great event, on which so much of our happiness depends; and it much concerns us to consider the value of it. First of all, we must think who the men are, who call upon us for such a stretch of our confidence, upon a matter to us of infinite moment. What if they are mistaken in their word, thus pledged for the Lords? Will it not be a great satisfaction to us to find ourselves the victims of aristocratic misrule, because Lord John Russell and the Attorney-General told us not to expect it? Let us, therefore, deliberately ask ourselves, whether it is more likely that they are mistaken in this word of theirs, or the contrary? If we should suppose, with them, that the light which is shining upon the rest of the community, and which may be expected, as they justly say, to shine every year with greater and greater force, will not permit the Lords to remain in the same thick darkness in which they are as yet immersed, will their greater degree of intelligence render them less disposed to pursue their own interests? Is such a supposition as this agreeable to our experience of human nature? Will not the Lords like to have power, as well after the wisdom of their inferiors has forced itself in some degree among them, as before? And will they not like as well to make that power available to their own ends, at the expense of the community? It is not to the ignorance of the aristocracy that we owe all our evils, but to a much deeper rooted cause—the preference which every man has of himself to another. Do Lord John and the Attorney-General really advise us to submit to the miseries of aristocratic misrule, till the wisdom of the Lords gets the Edition: current; Page: [300] better of this propensity? The shallowness of the view in which such a thought could originate is not the least remarkable thing in this emphatic advice. Lord John and his colleagues only expect this degree of wisdom to exist among the Lords, when it exists to such a degree in the community that they cannot remain devoid of it. This implies a state of things in which no man prefers himself to his neighbour—a state in which every man values his neighbour’s good as much as his own; for assuredly Lord John and his colleagues will admit that the Lords are the very last portion of the community whom this angelical spirit will reach. But is it possible Lord John and his colleagues should not see, that when the human mind has reached this stage of perfection, every man governs himself accurately, according to the truest principles of well-doing; and all government by others becomes useless; government ceases to exist. It follows with the force of demonstration, that we may trust to the wisdom of the Lords for their assent to good government, then, when government altogether becomes unnecessary, and not one moment sooner.
There is only one other pretence we can think of, which can be held up in favour of Lord John’s advice—that the Lords will grow wise enough to see the danger of resisting the will of the people.
To trust to this security is not in our opinion a wise scheme of governing; and to recommend it would assuredly be a great inconsistency in Lord John. Lord John is one of that class, or tribe, or sect, who dread the people. The impetus of the people is, according to them, one of the great evils in society, against which adequate securities can hardly ever be taken; and yet it is here proposed to make it an ever-acting power in the state. Where one power is employed for the counteraction of another, it must work whenever the other works. But the will of the Lords to benefit themselves at the expense of the rest of the community is in perpetual action;—so then must the impetus of the people, which restrains it. This, in the opinion of reformers, is not a desirable state of things, even if we were to admit the inadmissible supposition that it could exist permanently. It would imply a state of perpetual excitement; and what would add enormously even to that evil—a feeling of hostility between the higher and other classes in perpetual and vehement action. To be in this state is, as far as it goes, to be in a state of anarchy. The aim of all the arrangements of government, so far as they have not grown like trees, as Sir James Mackintosh would have them, but have been made under the guidance of reason, with a view to public Edition: current; Page: [301] good, is to trust no important series of results to uncertain causes—to impulses, which may or may not have place.
Lord John, and they whose thoughts run in the same channel with his, talk to us loudly about institutions; hold a language about institutions, as if no body had a regard for them but themselves; taking care, a large proportion of them, to include all abuses under the name of institutions. Well, then, we desire them to remark, that we, whom they calumniate as the enemies of institutions, because we are the enemies of abuses, are for checking the Lords by an institution; just as we are for securing all the other points of good government by institutions, and not by the irregular impulses of the people. Our institution, too, is the simplest thing in the world. It is merely that the assent of the Lords to a law deemed necessary for the public good, by the nation’s house of legislation, shall, after a period of refusal, be unnecessary. Is not this better than bringing down the people upon them on every occasion? Does not Lord John think enough, to perceive, that the people have only two modes of acting in such a way as to coerce a body of powerful men?—It is either by violence; or the prospect of violence, so near as to be terrifying; and this prospect of violence, so near as to be terrifying, is what Lord John proposes to make the habitual medicine of the state. Also we, the reformers, who wish to gain all our ends by institutions, that is, by established organs, adequate to the purpose, are the people to be distrusted for their want of regard to institutions. If, indeed, nothing is to be institution, in the language of our aristocratical revilers, but established organs for preserving aristocratical abuses, we are their enemies, and will assuredly persevere till we have destroyed them.
In taking away, however, from the Lords such power of legislation as we cannot secure from being used for bad purposes we would grant to them other powers, the mischievous use of which we should have the means of preventing. They should obtain both the right of voting for members of the house of representatives, and the right of being chosen members. We think that this would be attended with several good effects. It would hold out motives to all the young men of that class who had ambition for high place in the service of the state, to cultivate the qualifications which would give them pre-eminence in the field of free competition, and recommend them to the highest trusts. It would make a spontaneous change in the education of that class; they would seek to become, and therefore would become, intellectual men; and they would have adequate motives to cultivate the good opinion of the people, Edition: current; Page: [302] by the practice of all the virtues which render men valuable and acceptable to one another. They would become men of worth, in the highest and most endearing sense of the word; and possessing the means of doing good to others in a higher degree than men of inferior wealth, they would be more looked up to, and their wishes would be more consulted. They would still, if they chose, be the foremost men in the state, and with a happiness of which at present they have no conception.
We shall speedily, no doubt, hear, from those who make loyalty a virtue, whether well or ill bestowed,—that is to say, from those with whom in affairs of state the good of the people passes for nothing, but whom at last the people have learned to know, and are prepared, when the season comes, to treat as they deserve,—a loud accusation.
We shall be told, that, by this reasoning of ours, we destroy the foundation of monarchy as well as of aristocracy.
But those men, who have the monarchy appetite, at least the cant of it, for their virtue, and care for no other, are very shallow politicians; they never see more of a thing than its outside. We tell them, that monarchy rests on grounds totally different from those of aristocracy; and they are the great enemies of monarchy, who try to confound the two.
There is a great deal of foundation for what was urged with so much earnestness by the French Economistes, and by the penetrating philosopher, Hobbes,—that the interest of the monarch, and the interest of the people, are not opposite, but identical.
Let us take the leading particulars, and look at them for a moment.
The greatness of a King, to begin with that, is doubtless dependent upon, and measured by, the greatness of his people. What has made the King of England for centuries hold the high rank which he has done among the sovereigns of the earth? Not the numbers of his subjects. Not the riches of his soil. What then? The riches, that is, the productive powers of his people; who were prompted to exert themselves, because they knew that what they produced, they should have liberty to enjoy. Queen Elizabeth appears to have had more than a glimpse of this truth. When told that she was reproached for being shabby, what did she reply?—“My riches,” she said, “are in the pockets of my people, where they are much better placed than in mine; and therefore it is my resolution to take out of those pockets, not as much as possible, but as little.”
Next, for his glory. Abstracting from the greatness, the grounds of which we have explored in the preceding paragraph, Edition: current; Page: [303] what can that consist in but the high qualities of his people—their copious possession of all that contributes to well-being—their fame for high intelligence, for their skill in all the arts which supply the conveniences or ornaments of life—their love of their country, which gives them happiness—their social and domestic virtues? To be at the head of such a people, is to be at the very summit of glory.
And what, after this, has a king to wish for? A people, who themselves abound in all the means both of comfortable and of elegant living, will consider it for their own decoration that their king shall be pre-eminent in this, as in other respects. A king indeed, placed in these elevating circumstances, will be far above entering into a competition with his subjects in the tasteless display of wealth, or thinking any part of his dignity to consist in being able to make more waste than any other man in his dominions. He has better means of distinction.
How is it then, it will be asked in contradiction to us, that our kings of England, for example, have always been so much misled? When have they considered their greatness as identified with the freedom and happiness of their people? When have they considered it their glory to be at the head of a people eminent for their intellectual attainments and their moral worth? Experience, we shall be told, is against us.
The account of this matter is (for the fact is not to be disputed) that our kings have always linked themselves with the aristocracy, and have committed the grievous blunder of thinking the interests of the aristocracy the same with their own. They have degraded themselves by becoming the creatures of the aristocracy. They have no independent power, because they have separated themselves from the people. The aristocracy, after making them dependent upon themselves, have made a stalking-horse of them;—have talked in very lofty terms of their authority, and the obedience due to it, because they can employ it all for their own use, and with the vast advantage of having the king for a screen. The power of the sovereign has been converted into their power: no wonder they like it. But till that was brought about, how did they behave? Let history answer the question. They were the king’s antagonists, and his oppressors; and it was only by the aid of the people that he was ever able to make head against them. What was the contest with the Stuarts, but a contest to determine whether the king was to be master, or the aristocracy? If the king could rule without a parliament, the king was to be the master; if he could not, the aristocracy was to be the master, because the aristocracy at that time made the parliament. In this contest the Edition: current; Page: [304] aristocracy had the advantage, for the first time, of drawing the people to their side—gulled as they were by the name representative—as if a man, because he was called a representative, would take care of the people’s interests, though put into parliament only to take care of the interests of the aristocracy, and turned out when he failed to do so.
This contest was decided against the king, for ever; he discovered that he could not rule but in subservience to parliament. And what, in consequence, has he done? He has put his neck into the collar of the aristocracy, and to this hour tugs like a pack-horse at their waggon. He might have done better for himself, and better for the state;—he might have joined with the people in rescuing parliament from the gripe of the aristocracy; and then he would have been really subservient to nothing but the public interest, which he would have felt to be his.
Ever since the expulsion of the Stuarts, what has been the situation of the King of England in the hands of the aristocracy—his master, as well as the people’s? Read the authentic documents in Coxe’s biographical works, from Marlborough to Pelham inclusive. What was the government of England during the reigns of William, of Anne, of George the First, and George the Second, but a disgusting struggle among the aristocracy who should have the power of plundering the people? without its being thought necessary by a man among them to make even the pretence that a regard for the public good entered among his motives. There is no where else to be found such a display of immorality—of the utter abandonment of principle—of hardened, unblushing rapacity, as characterized the aristocracy in those days. The business of a minister was, by his intrigues, by his personal or family interest, to get a majority of those marauders to support him in parliament. The man who had obtained this, the king was obliged to make minister; and George the Second, with great bitterness, told the Chancellor Hardwicke, that whoever was minister was king in this country—not the cypher who bore the name.
There is no doubt that when a king is afraid of his people, and believes that he is only safe by being able to crush them, he has cogent motives to govern ill, and that in every possible way; to hinder his people from knowing; to hinder them from speaking; to plunder them to the utmost, for the sake of gorging those whose profligate assistance he may require; and to subject them to the most atrocious revenge for any appearance of a disposition to dispute his will. But when a king Edition: current; Page: [305] is satisfied that his throne is established on the rooted conviction in the minds of his people that it is good for them, he has no fear to provide against; no blackguards to hire, either to debase the understandings of the people, or to shed their blood. He has no higher ground of rejoicing than the blessings in which his people rejoice—plenty of the good things of life, with minds sufficiently cultivated to use them all to the best advantage.
And if it be true, that the interest of a king is not irreconcilable with the interests of his people, it is not yet proved that his office is an unnecessary one, or unattended with advantages which in no other way can be so perfectly attained.
A first magistrate is necessary; that is a fixed and undisputed point. The necessity of unity in matters of administration, the use of concentrated responsibility, and many other considerations, seem to place the balance of advantage on the side of the individuality of the first magistrate. He should be one, and not two, or more.
But if so, the only question which remains is,—whether he should be hereditary, or elective.
The chief advantage urged on the side of electiveness is the security for talent. With an hereditary first magistrate, the degree of talent is a matter of chance; with an elective, a high degree is tolerably certain.
If we allow this to be so, we have still the question to answer, whether the security for talent in the chief magistrate is a matter of much importance.
As it is very certain that he must govern in subservience to parliament; and as parliament will soon be chosen by the people, and responsible to the people, we should say that it is not in this country a matter of much importance.
It is clear to reason, and well proved by experience, that when the chief magistrate attempts to act as his own minister, he does no good, but evil; and if he chooses for his ministers, as in the above circumstances he must do, men agreeable to the parliament, he cannot go far wrong: they will always be, if not the very best men, among the best that are to be had.
In these circumstances, there are advantages of a very solid nature, on the side of the hereditary principle. The choice of the chief magistrate, if he is elective, must be given either to the parliament, or to the people. The evils are so obvious of giving the choice of the great administrative organ of government to the legislative organ, that we believe it has never been seriously contemplated. It would be the most effectual of all contrivances to fill that body with faction, to light up the evil Edition: current; Page: [306] passions, and to engross the minds of members with any thing rather than the interests of the country, the care of which, even in minute detail, is their great and infinitely important duty. The choice by the people is perhaps less pregnant with evil. But the agitation which must be created by so important a choice as that of head of the state, even for a few years, pervading the whole mass of the population, and carrying with it all the solicitations, all the intrigues, all the misrepresentations, all the calumnies, and all the estrangements, which it creates, is very unfavourable to all that is good in the minds of the people; among whom quietness and harmony, when they know that the securities for good government are firmly placed in their hands, are most desirable for every kind of prosperity—their prosperity in wealth, their prosperity in intellect, their prosperity in morals, and in all the ornaments of life.
If ever the King of England becomes clear-sighted enough to see that he has been very ill-advised, in leaning upon a corrupt aristocracy, and a corrupt church, as the two crutches without which he could not stand; and that he may rest with assurance on the solid advantages to the people, inherent in his office: he will occupy a far more exalted station in the social union than he has hitherto done. He will feel that he reigns in the reason and understanding of his people; which is a more steady reliance, than that reigning in their hearts, which he has hitherto heard so much about, and to so little purpose.
P. Q.

Edition: current; Page: [553]

Art. XIV.: WHETHER POLITICAL ECONOMY IS USEFUL?
A Dialogue between A. and B.

A.
I LIKE law better than political economy.


B.—
There is no disputing of tastes.


A.
I say, law is the more useful.


B.—
If the difference is only in degree, political economy may still be honoured with a high, though not the highest, degree of your esteem.


A.—
I really mean, that political economy is of no use at all.


B.—
Do you speak this of your own knowledge—or have you taken it upon trust from others?


A.—
Partly one, and partly the other.


B.—
I defer very much to your authority, and am always happy to be cured of an error; but I want something to my complete satisfaction, in adopting your opinion on this subject; and would, if I might take the freedom, ask a few questions. I am not sure that, by political economy, you and I mean the same thing.


A.—
Why should you suppose we do not mean the same thing?


B.—
I think it very often happens that, when men differ, they do so, because they do not mean the same thing. My suspicion, in the present case, arises from this, that I do not imagine you think the difference between truth and falsehood of no importance.


A.—
Certainly not.


B.—
You deem truth to be useful;—falsehood, or error, hurtful?


A.—
I do.


B.—
And the more useful, or the contrary, in proportion as the subject, to which the truth or falsehood relates, is the more important?


A.—
Yes.


B.—
What, then? do you think the subject to which political economy relates—the wealth of nations, a subject of no importance?—the causes by operation of which are produced and multiplied all the things, not spontaneously produced, which contribute to the subsistence and enjoyment of mankind; the distribution which the laws of nature impose upon them after they are produced; and the ends in subservience to which they are consumed?


A.—
The subjects themselves I think of great importance.

Edition: current; Page: [554]

B.—
True propositions, respecting things of great importance, you have allowed are useful; erroneous, or false propositions, hurtful. The difference between truth and error, on these subjects, is hence of great importance. I therefore think I have your confession that political economy is of great importance.


A.
How so?


B.—
From this single circumstance, that truth on important subjects is important.


A.—
Do you call political economy truth?


B.—
I do.


A.—
What! when so many contradictory doctrines are held?


B.—
Do you know anything more contradictory than truth and error?


A.—
I do not say that I do.


B.—
Do you know any subject, on which true opinions and erroneous opinions are not liable to be held?


A.—
Certainly not.


B.—
But, on all subjects, the true opinions are held to be the science of that subject; the wrong opinions not the science, but the reverse of the science. For example, the Newtonian system of astronomy is reckoned true, the vortices of Descartes, and the cycles of Ptolemy, erroneons systems; is not the Newtonian system, therefore, alone called the science of astronomy, the other two systems not?


A.—
It is so.


B.—
I doubt not, therefore, you see what follows.


A.—
What is it that follows?


B.—
That the science of political economy, if propriety of speech is observed, means, a combination of true propositions respecting the supply, distribution, and consumption of the articles or things composing the wealth of nations; putting aside and disallowing all erroneous propositions. This is what I call political economy.


A.—
I confess that what I have been calling political economy was not exactly this. What I understood by it was, a collection of propositions, partly erroneous and partly trifling.


B.—
Such was my supposition, when I ventured to say that, very probably, you and I, by the term political economy, did not mean the same thing. It appears now that we mean things very different indeed; and hence it is no wonder if, in speaking of them, we have used different and contradictory language—our meaning, all the while, being possibly the same. I, at least, should speak of your thing certainly in the language which you do,—that erroneous or trifling propositions, on the topics of national wealth, are not only useless but hurtful; and, Edition: current; Page: [555] possibly, you will allow, that true and important propositions on these topics are useful, and greatly so?


A.—
If there are propositions deserving that character. That true propositions are made on those topics, it is not necessary to dispute; but I think it very doubtful whether there are any which are important.


B.—
That is a point, unquestionably, from which all doubt should be removed, if it shall be found that any rests upon it. The question is one of vast importance, and ought to be thoroughly investigated. You have no objection, probably, to state your reasons for thinking that all the true propositions in political economy are trifling.


A.—
My reason is, that I do not know one which is of any importance.


B.—
Shall we then state the proposition directly, that we may have something precise about which to dispute, and say that there is no proposition of political economy of any importance?


A.—
You may, if useful to the dispute.


B.—
Even that, if conceded, would not be a solution of the question, because there are two cases. It may be, that no important proposition may yet have been made upon such or such a subject; while yet it may be possible that very important propositions are capable of being made.


A.—
Is it not sufficient, for calling political economy nonsense, if it should appear that it actually contains no proposition of any importance?


B.—
I think not; because the admission leads to consequences which, I believe, you will admit to be absurd.


A.—
What are they?


B.—
I can best make them appear, I believe, if I proceed in this way. Are you not of opinion that all sciences have had a beginning? That there was a time when, in all the great departments of human knowledge, nothing was known; and that the sciences have all been built up by degrees?


A.—
I believe that to have been the case.


B.—
There was a time, then, when it might have been said of astronomy, might have been said of chemistry, might have been said of mechanics, might have been said of logic, that they actually contained no proposition of importance.


A.—
I do not deny that.


B.—
Could it, however, have been truly and properly said, even at that time, that astronomy, chemistry, mechanics, logic, were all nonsense?


A.—
I think not.

Edition: current; Page: [556]

B.—
And the reason, I may presume, is, that even when no important propositions had yet been formed in these branches of knowledge, important propositions were still capable of being formed.


A.—
True.


B.—
To maintain your proposition, that political economy is nonsense, you must be prepared to show, not merely that no important proposition has yet been formed on the subject, but that no important proposition is capable of being formed.


A.—
I am not prepared to go so far as that. But is it not sufficient for calling a science nonsense, when as yet it contains nothing else?


B.—
I think it is an abuse of language to do so.


A.—
How is that made appear?


B.—
In the first place, the word nonsense, in such an application, is equivocal, and tends to convey a wrong opinion—not that a science which may be of the highest importance, is in its infancy, but that it cannot be made important. Thus we say of the ontology of the schoolmen, that it is nonsense; meaning, not merely that it actually contains nothing sound and useful, but that no useful proposition can be formed on such subjects. In the next place, it is a misappropriation of the term science, to apply it to a string of erroneous or trifling propositions. Science means a combination of propositions, both true and important, and so completely embracing the whole subject to which the propositions relate, as that nothing material in it shall be found, which some of the propositions do not include. Science is useful when it reaches all this; and the name is not deserved, and is not in correct language applied, till a near approach is made to that state of perfection.


A.—
How then would you express yourself, repecting a body of doctrine on a subject, the importance of which is not disputed, which doctrine you think to be nonsense?


B.—
One thing I am certain of—which is, that I should not call a parcel of nonsense propositions, science; I should as soon think of calling them wisdom. I should begin by calling them not science, but nonsense; which I do not reckon the same, but opposite. The proper language, I think would be, that the subject had not yet the benefit of science, and all that was known of it was of no use.


A.—
Well, then, let us apply your language to political economy, and say that the subject has not yet been allowed the benefit of science; that the propositions hitherto framed about it, are either untrue, or insignificant.


B.—
Taking this as your proposition, we have next to inquire whether it be well founded or not.

Edition: current; Page: [557]

A.—
Be it so. Let that be the inquiry.


B.—
We need not, I imagine, go far into the question whether any of the propositions in political economy are true; because it is easy to form true propositions, if the value be neglected, on any subject. Thus we may say, that labour produces commodities; that labour is painful, and only exerted with a view to some reward—that a man will execute more work with tools than without them: so also, we can say it is warmer in summer than in winter; an ox is commonly heavier than a sheep, and so on. The question you really propose is, whether there be in political economy, any proposition of great utility.


A.—
It is so.


B.—
It appears to me, here again, to be necessary to inquire, whether, when you employ the word utility, and I employ the word utility, we are both of us thinking of the same thing; not thinking, the one of us of one thing, the other of another.


A.—
Do you think that can be the case?


B.—
We shall proceed with much more satisfaction in our inquiry, if we first ascertain that point. And a few questions, I think, with your answers, will afford us the requisite information.


A.—
Be it so.


B.—
I can anticipate your answer to the first question I shall put—whether you think all utility to be that which is represented by pounds, shillings, and pence? You will say you do not.


A.—
I do.


B.—
You are, then, of opinion that there are more species of utility than one?


A.—
Certainly.


B.—
Shall we endeavour to ascertain its more general species—in this way, I mean; by asking ourselves if the nature of man does not consist of two parts, the body and the mind?


A.—
It does.


B.—
May we not, corresponding with these parts, consider as one class of useful things, those which conduce to the welfare of the body; another, those which conduce to the welfare of the mind?


A.—
We may.


B.—
By conducive to the welfare, I mean things serving to yield pleasure, or ward off pain, and that whether directly, or mediately, and indirectly.


A.—
I do not object to that definition.


B.—
One class of useful things, therefore, are those which serve to produce bodily pleasure, or ward off bodily pain: Edition: current; Page: [558] another, those which produce mental pleasure, or ward off mental pain.


A.—
These are the two most comprehensive species.


B.—
I do not think we are called upon, for the settling of the present question, to discuss their relative value, and ascertain whether, upon the whole, the well-being of the body, or the well-being of the mind, is of most importance. It is, no doubt, your opinion, that both are of great importance.


A.—
I think so.


B.—
And for our present purpose that is enough. The next step of our inquiry, is this:—As some things give pleasure to the body, without producing any other effect, and are useful on that account; are there not certain things which give pleasure to the mind, and are held useful, without regard to any ulterior effect? I may allude to astronomy as a sufficient illustration. That science, beyond some of its more familiar results, yields no guidance for the affairs of life. It is contemplative, and the pleasure which it yields is purely mental. But the pleasure which the mind receives, when it comprehends within its grasp a multitude of great objects, and traces distinctly their mutual operations and dependencies, is known to be very great. You do not hesitate, I suppose, to admit this?


A.—
Certainly not.


B.—
This pleasure, therefore, is a good; and that which procures it is useful.


A.—
That follows.


B.—
We need not inquire scrupulously into the comparative value of this pleasure. It is well-known how small is the value of all the merely corporeal pleasures, when taken nakedly by themselves, and without the addition of anything mental. The man who relishes most the pleasures of eating and drinking, flies from a solitary meal, and confesses that his enjoyment in it is reduced to little. Of the pleasures of love, we see that the bodily part is little valued when stripped of the mental, and that it is only the lowest of our species, who are found to be seriously under its influence.


A.—
All that is true.


B.—
You see to what this train of thought leads.


A.—
You mean the conclusion, that the purely mental pleasures, those which begin and end in the existence of pleasurable thoughts, hold a high rank among the enjoyments of our nature, and the causes of them among the things which we denominate useful.


B.—
You have traced the consequences clearly and well. We have now, therefore, agreed in certain points, which I think Edition: current; Page: [559] may be applied with advantage to the inquiry we are engaged in.


A.—
I shall be happy to hear in what way.


B.—
The matters which form the subject of political economy are matters in the highest degree interesting to mankind. They are, in fact, the multifarious operations concerned in producing, distributing, and exchanging; placing, in a word, in the hands of the consumers, all the things which constitute the wealth of individuals and of nations: the things for which, almost exclusively, the labours, the schemes, the cares, of human beings are expended. These operations are of many kinds, and are connected together in a system of great complexity,—following one another according to certain laws, checking one another according to certain laws,—aided by one set of arrangements, impeded by another. This complicated tissue of causes and effects, subordinate to ends the most interesting to human kind, it cannot but be an agreeable exercise to an ingenious mind to explore,—to trace the course of such things,—to mark their concatenations. And if it succeed, by its meditations on the order of events, in discovering how they follow one another in trains, so as to reduce them all to a moderate number of trains, by which they can, as a whole, be held all at once in the mind’s eye, and the mode in which every thing comes out can be distinctly comprehended; as a man raising himself to an eminence, from which he can look down upon a scene of the highest possible interest, not only beholds the numerous objects of which it consists, and their visible motions, but the causes of them, and the ends to which they are directed, and thence derives the highest delight;—is it not certain, that a similar commanding view obtained by the mind over a most interesting and complicated mental scene, must yield it a gratification of the highest value, even if no further consequence were to be derived from it?


A.—
Undoubtedly, such a commanding view of so great a part of the field of human action, in which operations so multifarious, and tending to such interesting results, are taking place, cannot but yield a high degree of pleasure: and he must be one of the lowest of his species, who will not acknowledge that such a gratification of the highest part of our nature—the intellectual part, must hold a foremost place among the pleasures we are capable of receiving.


B.—
I applaud this liberal declaration, and expected it from you. And now we, perhaps, have light to show us something of a matter which you, I expect, will acknowledge to be of the highest importance, but which is not often well understood; Edition: current; Page: [560] and by people who do not understand, and nevertheless are precipitate enough to judge without understanding, treated as of no importance.


A.—
What is that?


B.—
The connexion between that commanding view which we have been considering, and the kind of utility which these men understand,—the things which they can taste, handle, smell, and see,—the things, in short, which they can sell and buy in a market, and to which the term practical utility is by them appropriated. If this intellectual operation should be found to have a commanding influence even on this same practical or market utility, may we not expect them to change their opinion with respect to the value even of the mental process?


A.—
Certainly, that which increases the utility of other things, is itself useful.


B.—
Very justly said. You do not deny that arrangement, when applied to a multitude of operations, all contributing to some desirable end, renders those useful operations still more useful?


A.—
I do not.


B.—
As little will you deny that such operations do not commonly make the best arrangement of their own accord; that if left to themselves, one operation may obstruct another; the same thing may be done oftener than is needed, and the result of the whole be less than it would have been, if the causes at work had been better directed.


A.—
Nobody can doubt that.


B.—
Is not that arranging process, which you acknowledge to be of so much importance, that is, utility, wholly intellectual, the immediate result of that commanding view we have just been considering?


A.—
How so? I do not perceive that clearly.


B.—
Look at it thus. Can things be arranged which are not all taken account of? Can any thing be put in its place if it has not been considered; and considered in conjunction with all the things among which it is to have its appropriate place?


A.—
Certainly not.


B.—
For this arrangement, then, a comprehensive view—a view which takes in every thing, is indispensable?


A.—
It is.


B.—
But if things are to be arranged with a view to their operations on one another, and the tendency of all those operations to the producing of a certain effect, a much greater number of particulars must be taken account of. We may illustrate the case by a reference to a detached and very narrow Edition: current; Page: [561] portion of the matters comprehended within the vast province of political economy. The number of things and persons required in a cotton mill is considerable; and the effect which they are intended to produce is accomplished, more or less perfectly, quantity and quality considered, the more perfectly the productive means are arranged: is it not so?


A.—
Granted.


B.—
We may assume (may we not?) that the arrangements in the principal establishments of this kind are excellent in the extreme; that every thing is placed exactly where it ought to be placed,—that its operation comes in at the very moment when it ought to come in,—that every thing is formed to suit exactly the things by which it is acted upon, and the things upon which it acts,—that every power is exactly proportioned to the effect which it has to produce,—and all this to the end that there may be no waste of power, but that the ultimate produce may be obtained with the smallest possible expenditure of power?


A.—
I assent to all that.


B.—
Now, then, is it not necessary, for effecting a combination of all these things, so exquisite as to make them conspire, in the best possible manner, to the production of a particular effect, that the arrangement should be made by some pervading mind which takes a comprehensive view of the whole; which leaves nothing out of its consideration; which contemplates every part of the great co-operation; marks wherever there is any thing either too much or too little, where any one thing stands in the way of another, where any thing is wanting to the complete operation of another thing; and which, by help of this knowledge, places and proportions every thing? Does it appear to you possible, that a thing can be organized as a whole, without a knowledge of the whole? Can the general of an army arrange the multiplied operations of a battle without holding them all in his mind, by a comprehensive view, which enables him to arrange them, each one so perfectly in connexion with all, that each contributes in the utmost degree to the production of the general end—the defeat of the enemy?


A.—
This cannot be disputed.


B.—
The officer of a company, or the head of a division, knows the particulars of his own subordinate part, and makes therein the appropriate arrangements; but it is only the general over all—he whose mind pervades the operations of all—it is he who combines them into one co-operative scheme—it is he alone who, by aid of his comprehensive and commanding view, is in circumstances which enable him to do so; and it is the man who makes use of that knowledge the most skilfully—who Edition: current; Page: [562] arranges the several parts of his force so as to turn it to the best possible account, and derive the greatest assistance from it in the accomplishment of his end—that is the man who is the greatest general.


A.—
It is so.


B.—
We may then, I think, lay it down, with your consent, as a general proposition, that wherever a great many agents and operations are combined for the production of a certain result, or set of results, a commanding view of the whole is absolutely necessary for effecting that combination in the most perfect manner.


A.—
I agree.


B.—
But a commanding view of a whole subject, in all its parts, and the connexion of those parts, is it anything but another name for the theory, or science of the subject? Theory (θεωρια) is literally view; and science is scientia, knowledge: meaning view, or knowledge, not solely of this and that part, but, like that of the general with his army, of the whole.


A.—
I see the inference to which you are proceeding: you mean to say, that the theory or science of political economy is a commanding view of the vast combination of agents and operations engaged in producing for the use of man, the whole of the things which he enjoys and consumes: in other words, the things which he denominates the matter of wealth—the great object to which almost all the toils and cares of human beings are directed.


B.—
You have anticipated me correctly.


A.—
You would farther proceed to ask me, I have no doubt, whether the innumerable operations which take place in subservience to that end, may not take place in more ways than one; in short, in a worse way, or in a better way? Whether it is not of importance that they should take place in the best way? And whether the difference between the best way and the worst way, is not likely to be very great?—great, I mean, in respect to the particular end, the production of the matter of wealth. And to all these questions I should answer in the affirmative.


B.—
I should become in love with controversy, if I always met with such controvertists as you. Not only do you never resist conviction, by contending for a point after you see it is untenable, but when you have assented to a proposition which you formerly rejected, your mind moves forward, descries the other propositions to which the newly-admitted one conducts, and embraces them with the readiness of a practised and sincere pursuer of truth.


A.—
I should be unworthy of the name of a man, if I did not Edition: current; Page: [563] embrace a proposition, the moment I see that there is evidence to support it.


B.—
There are those who take the name of men, and names which they value higher, who do not feel this delicacy, and act under no such obligation. But this is from the purpose. Admitting, as you have done, that on the proper ordering and conducting of the great and numerous trains of operations, subservient to the production and use of wealth, a great deal depends; that between good ordering, and bad ordering, the difference in respect to beneficial results is immense; you will, I doubt not, allow, as you have done in general, that in this particular case, every thing cannot be well arranged without taking account of every thing; that the man who sees all is he alone who can arrange all—he alone who can discover if all the parts are, or are not, in co-operation; and how any change can be made in one part without affecting injuriously some other; in short, that the general, commanding, and complete view of the subject, which is properly denominated the science, is that alone which can with reason be looked to for the greatest of all possible benefits in the great affair, making everything concerned in it contribute in the highest degree to the attainment of the end.


A.—
The conclusion seems to me to be incontrovertibly made out.


B.—
I may now, then, reckon you a convert to my opinion—that the science of political economy is an important science?


A.—
If there be such a science, and if that which goes by the name, instead of being that all-comprehensive view which you have been speaking of, and the importance of which I fully admit, be not mere scraps of a view—mostly incorrect, and leading to no useful conclusion.


B.—
I grant to you most readily that it is a fair inquiry, whether the doctrine taught under the title of political economy deserves the name of science or not. In order to determine the question, perhaps you will point out which you think the criteria, or tests of a science—the marks or characters by which any combination of doctrines may be known to be, or not to be, science.


A.—
I doubt whether I am competent to such a task as that.


B.—
But if we have not in our minds a pretty accurate conception of what is and is not a science; that is, if we have not some standard by which to try every scheme of doctrine offered to us for science, what can we do? We cannot consider ourselves entitled to pronounce either for it or against it; to say Edition: current; Page: [564] whether it is science or not science, unless we know by satisfactory marks what is a science, what not.


A.—
True; and I see that I have not acted very rationally in pronouncing the doctrine of the political economists no science, unless I had been better advised respecting the constituents of a science. But still I am of opinion that one may see enough of a set of doctrines to say of them that they do not come up to the height of a science, even if he has but an indistinct notion of the essential qualities of a science; he may see either that the propositions are disputed, or that they do not explain all the subject.


B.—
You have here announced two marks which you think distinctive of a science; 1st, That the propositions be not disputed; 2ndly, That they explain the whole subject. Have you any more?


A.—
Not at the instant; but I think these, upon considering them, are sufficient.


B.—
To determine that point have we not two questions to resolve; 1st, Whether they are true marks; and, 2ndly, Whether they are adequate?


A.—
Are they not true marks?


B.—
With respect to the first of them, is it not possible for a proposition to be true and yet to be disputed?


A.—
I cannot deny that; yet truth, it is said, prevails in the long run.


B.—
You remember, I doubt not, the saying of Hobbes, so often quoted and approved, that if the truths of mathematics had been opposed to the interests of men having power, they would have been disputed against and denied; and the people persecuted who maintained them?


A.—
I do.


B.—
When the men, whose power enables them to set the fashion in opinions, as in dress, deem a set of doctrines opposed to their interest, were it but the interest of their ease, calling upon them for a disagreeable exertion of thought to learn and understand them—do you not see the possibility of these propositions being disputed for a long time, however true they may be—of their being honestly rejected and deemed of no importance by the greater number of men?


A.—
I see how often that occurs, and I cannot but admit that few men form their opinions upon the evidence of their truth; that the feeling of interest sways the minds of the greater number in what they believe or disbelieve, and to such a degree, that some men are under a sort of incapacity of thinking but as their interests direct; and I admit that the general supineness Edition: current; Page: [565] of men’s minds makes them ready, even for the saving of trouble, and when the opinions do not concern any other interest, to take for granted the truth of those which are inculcated upon them, particularly by those who have an ascendancy, from their power, station, or reputation.


B.—
I do not think, therefore, that you will insist upon it as a clear index against the scientific character of a set of opinions, that they are disputed, because we know that the Newtonian theory of astronomy was long disputed; that the utility of the Star Chamber was long maintained; that a government really representative of the people was long treated as a mischievous delusion.


A.—
Let us change the term undisputed, to true; you will not object to truth as one of the tests?


B.—
Certainly not, if I am enabled first of all to test the truth. Your two marks, according to the change you propose, will then be, 1st, That the propositions be truth; 2ndly, That they completely expound the subject. And nobody will deny that a set of true propositions, fully expounding a subject, are the science of that subject. But these marks avail us nothing till we have the means of determining what are true propositions, and whether they do embrace the whole of the subject. Can you name any tests by which either of these points can be determined?


A.—
I cannot; but are we then to rest in the opinion that it is impossible to determine whether there is any science or not?


B.—
I should say not, if we can do anything better; and I think we should by all means inquire how far we can advance, in determining either that a proposition is true, or that a set of propositions contain the entire exposition of a subject. On the latter question it is easier to approach the point of assurance than on the former, which is a reason for considering that in the first place, if you see no objection.


A.—
I see no objection.


B.—
It appears to me, that a subject may be contained within a definition or description, in such a manner that it may appear little less than certain that no part of it is left out, though to attain that certainty the doubt may be incurred whether more is not included than enough.


A.—
I assent to that opinion.


B.—
When the whole of a subject is thus before the inquirer, he may divide it into portions, and afterwards subdivide those portions into other portions, small enough and simple enough for easy and sure comprehension.

Edition: current; Page: [566]

A.—
He may do so.


B.—
Propositions expounding those portions may therefore be made with tolerable ground of certainty; and when the propositions on all such portions are put together, they cannot but constitute a full exposition of the subject.


A.—
That is true.


B.—
Let us apply to political economy the points we are thus agreed upon. Is it possible to make a definition or description of the subject of political economy, of which we may be sure, though it may include something which belongs not to the subject, that it leaves nothing out? As for example, if we say the subject of political economy is the system of operations concerned in the producing and using of the matter of wealth, may we not conclude, with some assurance, that our definition includes the whole of the subject? Let us consider thus:—In regard to any object of human pursuit, do not the end and the means comprehend all that we are interested in knowing about it? Thus, in regard to medicine, the end is the removal of diseases, the means the whole resources of the medical art. Well, then, the science of medicine is the knowledge of diseases, and of the means of cure.


A.—
All this is sufficiently evident.


B.—
In what regards wealth, for which men watch and toil, and on the plentiful or scanty supply of which the happiness or misery, the power or weakness of nations so greatly depends, the use is the end, the production the means. The question is, whether the doctrines of political economy entirely embrace these objects. Let us first examine if they do so in regard to production. The two great instruments are human labour, and that with which, and upon which, labour is employed—the two last included under the term capital. If political economy, therefore, expounds the natural laws, according to which labour and capital are employed in production, they fully comprehend this part of the subject. Without going into details, I suppose we may assume, as this is not a controverted part of political economy, that the doctrines do embrace, without any omission, this part of the subject?


A.—
Allowed.


B.—
The first act of using, subsequent to production, is possessing, that is, reception of shares. The next act of using is, when that which is thus possessed by any one is not the article he wants, but may be, and is, exchanged for it. The next, and last act of using is consumption. Appropriation, exchange, and consumption are, therefore, the three divisions of this last portion of the subject of political economy. Though, with respect Edition: current; Page: [567] to the truth of all the expositions of these subjects, there is not a perfect agreement among inquirers, I believe there is no dispute as to the completeness with which they embrace them. There is no dispute, for example, that the whole of the annual produce falls into three shares—one to the labourers, one to the capitalists, and one to the owners of land. The great question is, what regulates these shares, and determines so much to one and so much to another. It is well known, that the attempts of philosophers to ascertain the principle of wages, the principle of profits of stock, and the principle of rent, are attempts towards the solution of that question, and that whether their conclusions are true or false, they embrace all the parts of it. Next, with regard to exchange—its two great divisions are, exchange of home commodities for one another, exchange of home for foreign commodities. And the questions are, what are the purposes to which these exchanges are respectively subservient; what are the laws which regulate them,—in other words, which determine the quantity of one commodity which shall be given in exchange for another, in the several cases of home and of foreign exchange; and what is the nature and principles of money, the great instrument of facilitating exchanges? Whatever difference of opinion there may be as to the conclusions which inquirers have come to upon these subjects, it is not doubted, I believe, that they comprehend the whole of what it is useful to know in regard to them. We come now to the last part of using, which is consumption. That is divided into two kinds. There is no doubt, that whatever part of the annual produce falls to the share of any man, he uses it in one or other of two ways; either in the way of production, for the sake of what it may again yield, or for some purpose of necessity or pleasure to which it is sacrificed. And these two kinds of consumption, the productive, and the non-productive, include everything; the wealth of every member of the state, and by aggregation, of the state itself. The nature and consequences of these modes of consumption are embraced by the doctrines of political economy. And from this deduction it appears, that the science of the wealth of nations is entirely embraced by political economy.


A.—
It does so appear.


B.—
Political economy, therefore, possesses one of the qualities which you represented as essential to a science, that it should explain the whole of the subject to which it relates.


A.—
It is so.


B.—
The next of your essentials was, that the doctrines should be true. What, then, is the test to which we shall apply the doctrines of political economy, in order to know whether they are true?

Edition: current; Page: [568]

A.—
The disagreement about them, of political economists themselves, is a sufficient proof of the uncertainty, at least, of all their conclusions.


B.—
Is it your opinion, that all doctrines which are disputed are untrue, or at least unproved?


A.—
Not always, perhaps, but generally.


B.—
Then I claim the benefit of the exception for political economy: its doctrines are true, but not undisputed.


A.—
How do you prove that it is an exception?


B.—
How do you prove that it is not?


A.—
I do not undertake to prove it; but I esteem disagreement a reason for disbelief.


B.—
This, as a rule of conduct, would carry you far. There is disagreement on a question of right, in every case of litigated property. Do you conclude, in all such cases, that there is no right on either side? There was a time, when all the men and women in Europe believed the Pope to be infallible: was that proposition, then, true? A time came, when it was disputed: did it then cease to be true? When Galileo affirmed that the earth travelled round the sun, not the sun round the earth, his proposition was universally disputed: was it, then, untrue? It is now, in civilized countries, at least, universally believed: is it now, therefore, true?


A.—
I do not say that, being disputed, makes a proposition false; it only shows that it is not proved to be true.


B.—
Is it, then, your opinion, that truth is never disputed; never after it is proved? You would, in that case, reduce the number of established truths to a short catalogue. It is even denied that the establishment of property is useful, or the institution of government.


A.—
I do not consider it a presumption against an opinion, that it is disputed by a few wrong-headed people.


B.—
I will not suppose, also, that you hold it a presumption against an opinion, that it is opposed by a multitude of people, however great, if the subject be one which they cannot understand.


A.—
No; the opinion of people who are capable of understanding the subject, and who have used the due means of understanding it, are the only people whose opinions afford a presumption either for or against any proposition or propositions regarding it.


B.—
Then you think that the opinions of those who, with a due degree of intellect, have used the due means of understanding the doctrines of political economy, that is, of the political economists themselves, are the only opinions which afford Edition: current; Page: [569] any presumption either for or against the doctrines which go under that name?


A.—
I think so.


B.—
And, thinking so, I have no fear that you will run from the consequences.


A.—
What consequences do you mean?


B.—
One is, that the doctrines of political economy are of great importance.


A.—
How does that appear to be a consequence?


B.—
You have said that the opinions of sensible men, who have studied a subject, are the only opinions which form a presumption in favour of any proposition relating to it. Now all political economists, in whatever else they disagree, are all united in this opinion, that the science is one of great importance. There is, therefore, according to you, the strongest presumption of its importance.


A.—
I do not dispute the importance it might be of, were a set of propositions embracing the whole subject actually established. But I am justified in holding it of no importance, so long as nothing important is established.


B.—
Will you allow me to observe, that you have as yet offered no test of defective establishment, but a want of general concurrence. Do you not allow that a proposition is established, when it is proved?


A.—
I allow that. But the proof may be supposed to be defective, when it is not generally admitted.


B.—
You do not mean, when it is not admitted by the generality of those who know nothing about it?


A.—
No; I mean of those who study it.


B.—
But what proof have you, that the generality of those who study and know political economy, are not agreed about its doctrines?


A.—
See what contradiction there is, on almost all the leading points, among the writers on the subject.


B.—
I believe you are here led into an error, by a superficial appearance.


A.—
How do you mean?


B.—
You take the proportion of the writers who oppose the standard doctrines, for the proportion of the well-instructed people who oppose them; but the fact is very different. The writers are some half-dozen individuals, or less. And who are the people who write in such a case? Why, any creature who takes it into his head that he sees something in a subject which nobody else has seen. On the other hand, they who, after studying the subject, see the truth of the doctrines generally Edition: current; Page: [570] taught, acquiesce in them, hold to them, act upon them, and do not write. Every creature who objects, writes: they who believe, do not write. You thus know all the objectors, you have the knowledge of them forced upon you; you are ignorant of the thousands who do not object. And what can be gathered unfavourable to any doctrine, from the circumstance that some half-dozen individuals are found, with vanity enough, to think that they are wiser on that subject than the sum of all the other men who have studied it? Are persons ever wanting of that description, to oppose any system of propositions, however well established?


A.—
I acknowledge the weight of the observation thus far; that those who desire to make objections commonly print, those who receive the doctrines do not print; and that the believers, therefore, may be a much greater number than they appear. But we have very strong evidence, that the number of those who admit the objections is also great. Do not the members of the legislature, the greater part of them, not only disclaim all confidence in the doctrines of political economy, but treat its pretensions to science as imposture?


B.—
Of those members who disclaim all confidence in political economy, how many do you suppose speak with knowledge, how many without it?


A.—
If I am to speak my opinion honestly, I doubt whether any. The greater part of them disclaim the knowledge, as well as the confidence; and those who do not so, leave nobody in doubt of the fact.


B.—
But of those who know, and those who do not know a subject, of which are the opinions of any value? Were a blind man to give you his opinion upon the colours of any assortment of things placed before him, would you not treat the man as foolish, and his opinion good for nothing?


A.—
The opinion of a man without knowledge must be allowed to be worth nothing at all. I think it ought not to be called an opinion: it is only so much unmeaning sound. He who utters the propositions, neither puts together nor separates ideas: he only puts together positive or negative terms.


B.—
If ever so many people were to utter these unmeaning sounds—some on one, some on the other side of any question—they could not be considered as adding anything whatsoever to the presumptions on either. The people, therefore, in the legislature, void of knowledge, who say they distrust and despise political economy, make no presumption against the doctrines against which they vent only a senseless noise.


A.—
I cannot but agree with you.

Edition: current; Page: [571]

B.—
Even with regard to the supposition on which they mainly build, that there is such a diversity of opinion among political economists as raises a presumption against their doctrines, the fact is the reverse. Among those who have so much knowledge on the subject as to entitle their opinions to any weight, there is a wonderful agreement, greater than on almost any other moral or political subject. On the great points, with hardly any exception, there is general concord; and even on those points on which controversy is maintained, the dispute is about words, the ideas being in almost all cases the same. Take a summary view of the subject. In the great doctrines concerning production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, you find perfect concurrence; it is only as to some of the minor questions involved in these great doctrines that there is any dispute; and I might undertake to show that in few instances is even that dispute other than verbal.


A.—
I should like to hear you do so, if an inquiry, which must run into great detail, would not require more time than we can afford.


B.—
But if this undertaking of mine is not more than I can perform, the question is at an end. There is no branch of human knowledge more entitled to respect; and the men who affect to hold it in contempt afford indication only against themselves.

Art. IX.: THEORY AND PRACTICE.
a dialogue.

X.
Sir, I am no theorist.


Y.
Will you then give me leave to ask what you are?


X.
I follow experience.


Y.
You will probably accuse me of only starting a foolish paradox, if I affirm that experience and theory are the same; and that, of course, in saying that you follow experience and not theory, you declare your ignorance of both.


X.
What, sir, theory and experience the same! Are they not direct contraries—the one opposed to the other?


Y.
In my opinion they are not; and I am willing, if you think it worth your while, to enter upon the inquiry with you; and to seek for the means of determining whether your opinion or mine be correct.


X.
There can be no means of showing me that experience is the same with theory. Why, sir, is not theory speculation, and is not experience practice? Are not practice and speculation opposed to one another?


Y.
I admit that the terms are often opposed to one another. Many a man speaks of the one as good, the other as evil; but in the minds even of those men there is no opposition in the ideas. Edition: current; Page: [224] What they praise under the name of experience, is theory; what they blame under the name of theory, is practice.


X.
This is potently affirmed; you are on a way to reach the summit of paradox in time.


Y.
I expected your accusations. But accusations, if they are not just, need only to be examined. I am, therefore, anxious to commence with you the examination of yours.


X.
Well, sir, will you begin?


Y.
Willingly, if you prefer that I should. You think there is a great difference between theory and experience. If I ask you to state the difference, do not accuse me of seeking in inanity the reputation of subtlety. I wish to narrow, as far as possible, the field of our investigation, and imagine that this single question involves the whole. I deny there is any difference; you say there is; it is for you to show what it is.


X.
It seems no difficult matter to state the difference between theory and experience. In following experience we follow facts; in following theory we follow fancy.


Y.
The difference you adduce is the difference between following facts and following fancy. What we have to do, then, is to compare the following of facts with the following of fancy. But in order to do so we must compare the ideas, and not merely the terms. We must, therefore, begin by stating the ideas.


X.
We must do so.


Y.
Will you then state what appear to you to be the ideas respectively designated by those two expressions, or will it be more agreeable to you that I should state them?


X.
As you propose to make the comparison, it seems convenient that you should place in your own light the things to be compared.


Y.
To this I have no objection, provided I carry you along with me; otherwise you are sensible that my comparison would not answer our common end, that of a mutual discussion.


X.
Certainly not.


Y.
I can only know that I carry you along with me, if you allow me, setting aside thus far the laws of modern politeness, to put my statements in the form of questions, you signifying in reply your assent or dissent.


X.
I see that the form of question and answer will give facilities to our disquisition, and that the substance of politeness may be preserved though we dispense with some of its formalities.


Y.
The first thing I have then to do is to set forth the ideas involved in the phrase ‘following examples.’
An example is a past fact; it is an event of yesterday, or the last week, or year, or more distant period. But it is not every Edition: current; Page: [225] event which is an example. A man died last week, a bird flew in the air: these are events, but not examples, meaning by example an act to be repeated. An act to be repeated, or an example to be followed, is an act followed by certain consequences. These consequences also must be agreeable consequences. Does this accord with your idea of an example? Shall we call it a past act followed by agreeable consequences?


X.
This seems to be the proper account of it.


Y.
But a past act is a thing done, and cannot be revived. There may be a series of acts one after another, but for an act to be after it has been is an evident impossibility. Your act of to-day is not your act of yesterday, nor is your act of any one moment that of the preceding moment. When an act is finished it is gone, and gone for ever. What then is it that you mean by following a past act?


X.
Doing one that is like it.


Y.
Expecting, I presume, a similar result. Because a man who has thrown corn on the ground has reaped a greater quantity than that which he sowed, we too throw corn on the ground expecting a similar advantage.


X.
Expectation of a similar result is doubtless included in the idea of following an example.


Y.
An example, then, is a sequence; it includes at least an antecedent and a consequent.


X.
It does so.


Y.
This is one point of importance, and we may consider it settled; but here we have to remove a difficulty. A solitary fact yields no guidance. It is an admitted principle that from an individual instance no conclusion can be drawn. A man may have fallen from a high tower and have received little injury; he who should follow this as an example would probably pay dear for being so practical a man.


X.
I think, sir, you may here be accused of some misrepresentation. In defining a practical man, two sets of cases are to be distinguished; the cases which may be regarded as constant, and the cases which are accidental. Practice does not follow the latter, but the former.


Y.
You say well, sir, and have gone a great way towards proving my proposition, that what is called practice is in reality theory.


X.
How you are to make good that affirmation it is for you to discover.


Y.
It is so; then observe. Did you not say that practice was following cases of constancy?


X.
Yes.


Y.
What is it then we understand by cases of constancy? Is it Edition: current; Page: [226] not cases in which like antecedents have been followed by like consequents many times?


X.
It is.


Y.
But to follow these cases we must know them: to follow them without error we must know them accurately, and distinguish them in every instance from cases merely accidental. It is very evident that all good practice must depend upon this knowledge, and whatever contributes most to render this knowledge perfect and unerring, contributes most to the perfection of practice.


X.
No one will dispute that proposition.


Y.
We acquire our knowledge of a case of constancy by having observed the event—an antecedent followed by a consequent in a variety of instances—first one, then another, then another, and so on. Having observed these instances we remember them; so far our knowledge consists of the remembrance of our observations. But this knowledge is only of the past; all practice regards the future. You will to do a certain thing not yet done, and you will to do it for the sake of a certain consequence. How is it that your knowledge of the past becomes a guide of the future?


X.
Nothing is easier than the reply to that question. As things have happened in the past, so do they in the future. This we have always observed, and this we expect.


Y.
That you expect, it is true; but how do you expect it? Why should things be in the future as they have been in the past?


X.
The reason is because they have been always observed to be so.


Y.
A like antecedent has been followed by a like consequent, not once, but many times. The remembrance of this is the first step of the proceeding which you call practice; the second is the act, performed by you under expectation of the usual consequence: the expectation, you say, grounded upon the remembrance. But the grounding of an expectation upon a remembrance is a metaphorical expression, and ought to be translated into simple language. Will you have the goodness to do so?


X.
It may be done, I imagine, thus:—the antecedent A has been constantly followed by the consequent B; therefore the antecedent A will be constantly followed by the antecedent B.


Y.
That is to say, you frame from your past experience a general theorem: having observed that A has been followed by B, you say, indefinitely, A is followed by B; and on this theorem you ground your practice. According to you, therefore, to draw up a theorem from observation of the past, and to act upon it, is practice?


X.
It is.

Edition: current; Page: [227]

Y.
But is it not also theory?


X.
How do you make it appear to be theory?


Y.
Because theory consists in drawing up a theorem for the guidance of the future from the observation of the past.


X.
That I should not call theory at all.


Y.
Do you know any theory that is any thing else?


X.
Certainly I do—many; for example, the vortices of Descartes.


Y.
As you began this discussion by expressing a preference of experience to theory as a guide of practice, I concluded that we had in view only that class of theories which have a reference to future practice; not those attempts sometimes called theories, to account for certain phenomena, that is, bring them under some law which is already ascertained. The nature of this last class of theories I have no objection to discuss, as the consideration will confirm rather than invalidate the proposition I maintain. But as they are things which, though often confounded under one name, are very different in their nature, I should wish, with your leave, to confine our attention in the first instance to theories forming the groundwork of practice; such as the mercantile theory in political economy, the Brownonean theory in medicine. Do you know any theories of that kind which are not essentially theorems drawn up from the observation of the past for the guidance of the future?


X.
Yes, I think I can mention various theories, the mere offspring of fancy as I called it at the beginning; the fancy, for example, of the alchemists about finding gold.


Y.
It is not a very apposite example, as it may be alleged to partake more of bad practice than bad theory; unless you will call the gamester a theorist, and tell us that he commits his folly by quitting practice and pursuing theory.


X.
This is a forced similarity, and neither proves that the gamester is a theorist, nor disproves that the alchemist is one.


Y.
A short examination will show us whether the similarity is imaginary or not. The alchemist has observed very strange and unexpected results from chemical compositions and decompositions. He says to himself, why may not gold be among these results? He sees no reason why, nor can any man see a reason why. So far he theorizes, and so far only; and so far he proceeds correctly. He next advances to practice, and there he errs. The gamester has also observed very strange turns of fortune at the gaming table in favour of various individuals as well as himself. On each renewed occasion he says to himself, why should there not be a turn of fortune highly favourable to me on this occasion? No man can deny that there may be. Thus far he Edition: current; Page: [228] also theorizes, and theorizes correctly. He proceeds, however, immediately to a practice which is wrong. Is there not now something of a similarity?


X.
There is the appearance at least of a similarity; but there seems to be also an essential difference. Because certain remarkable things have resulted from certain known chemical operations, to suppose that gold will result from certain unknown chemical operations is a very different thing from expecting that dice will turn up in a way in which they have turned up before.


Y.
All comparisons hold only in certain respects. A dog taking arsenic and a man taking arsenic are very different things; with respect to the arsenic and its effects the cases are similar. So in the cases of the gamester and the alchemist, the similarity to the purpose in hand is complete. In the case of the alchemist there is a chance of his making gold, but there are many chances against him; in the case of the gamester there is a chance of his having good luck, but there are many chances against it. Each of them chooses to act upon the one chance and disregard the many. This is not theory: all theory shows that the many chances are better than the few. The instances you have produced are not, therefore, instances of theories drawn up from fancy. It still remains to be known if you can produce others which are.


X.
Though it may not be possible to produce a theory which has not some reference to facts, which is not in some degree founded on the observation of the past, (for any theory laid down for the guidance of the future, which is not in some degree founded on the past, would be a mere exhibition of insanity,) yet I think any theory drawn from a very insufficient observation of the past, any theory inconsistent with facts and an erroneous guide for the future, may be justly enough denominated the creature of the fancy.


Y.
If we give up the existence of theories which are not founded on the observation of the past, and allow that all theories are founded on it, we have then but two classes of theories—those which are accurately founded on an observation of the past, and those which are not accurately founded on it. The former, I suppose, you would not call fancies, but only the latter.


X.
Only the latter.


Y.
I have no objection to your calling them by any name you please, provided only you do not confound them with the other; and having advanced thus far it is time to see what conclusions we are prepared to draw.


X.
I shall be happy to hear what they are.


Y.
We have seen that all practice, all at least which deserves Edition: current; Page: [229] the name of rational, is founded upon an observation of the past, have we not?


X.
We have so.


Y.
We have also agreed that all theories are founded, though some correctly, some incorrectly, upon an observation of the past Theory and practice therefore are both founded on the same thing.


X.
They are so; but few theories are correctly founded.


Y.
Is there not such a thing as erroneous practice?


X.
There is, but not so common as erroneous theory.


Y.
Is not erroneous practice that which is not correctly founded upon the observation of the past?


X.
I tis.


Y.
Is not erroneous theory that which is not correctly founded upon the observation of the past?


X.
It is.


Y.
Error of practice and error of theory then are both owing to the same thing?


X.
It seems so.


Y.
We have said that all practice, which is the producing antecedents for the sake of consequents, is acting according to the remembrance of constancy in many instances?


X.
We have.


Y.
The remembrance of the constancy of sequence in many instances, when put into language, is a theorem. Thus, corn thrown into the ground produces corn, and the quantity produced is greater than the quantity producing. This is the remembrance of a constant sequence, and it is a theorem. The practice of sowing corn, is founded upon this remembrance; it is, therefore, founded upon the theorem. Is it not so?


X.
It is.


Y.
But what is the difference between a theorem and a theory?


X.
They seem indeed to be pretty closely connected.


Y.
The theory is merely a name of the thought or idea, and theorem is the name of the proposition which gives it expression.


X.
It seems so.


Y.
In following a theorem, therefore, or the remembrance of a constant sequence, we are following a theory; and as all practice follows this remembrance, all practice is founded upon theory, and there is no practice without theory?


X.
I cannot deny that it is so.


Y.
But if there is no practice without theory, it is altogether absurd to set practice in opposition to theory; and those people who condemn others by saying you follow theory, and extol themselves by saying we follow practice, only show the wretched state Edition: current; Page: [230] of their own minds; they know not what practice is. When a man says that he follows practice, he says by the same words that he follows theory. All men, therefore, in every rational action of their lives are followers of theory; and they may be divided, may they not, into the two following classes—those who follow good and those who follow bad theory; the first sort acting always right, the second always wrong?


X.
The conclusion is legitimately drawn.


Y.
The inquiry then of principal importance is what are the properties of a good theory and a bad?


X.
Certainly.


Y.
We have already made some progress in that inquiry. We have seen that in the formation of all theories the object is to ascertain a case of constant sequence; when that is correctly ascertained and correctly expressed in words, the expression may be said to be a correct theory. Any set of words, on the other hand, which professes to set forth a case of constant sequence, but sets forth as constant a case that is not constant, or sets forth one that is, incorrectly—such set of words may be termed a wrong theory. May we not assume these, as just descriptions of good theories and bad theories in kind?


X.
I think we may.


Y.
But good theory as a kind is a very lumping expression, and combines species which he who would arrive at clearness of ideas on this important subject must not neglect to distinguish.
Of two theories, each the expression of one constant sequence, the sequence expressed by the one may be a sequence on the due or undue observance of which much of human happiness or misery may depend; the sequence expressed by the other may be one with which good or evil to mankind has little or no connexion. Thus, the sequence of night and day is one, the knowledge of which is of vast importance to mankind. The regular revolution of the satellites of Jupiter round that planet is a sequence, the knowledge of which is of little importance. Theories are of importance, therefore, in proportion as the sequences of which they are the expression have much or little influence on human life.


X.
That is true.


Y.
A theory may express correctly the tracing of a sequence, but a tracing which has proceeded only a certain way. A theory may also express correctly the tracing of the same sequence, when the tracing has proceeded a greater way. The theory expressing the tracing which has gone the furthest is of course the most valuable. Instances to illustrate the observation are innumerable. The tendency of bodies to the earth was traced at an early Edition: current; Page: [231] period, and the sequence was at last correctly expressed in the theorem, that the tendency of bodies to the earth, or the time required in falling to it, is as the squares of the distances. The sequence was traced much further when Sir Isaac Newton discovered that the same law regulated the motions of the planets, and to this enlargement of the comprehensiveness of the theory the greatest honour was attached.


X.
And very justly.


Y.
We may, therefore, lay it down, with your consent, as a rule, that a theory is always the more valuable the greater the extent of sequence which it correctly announces. This, in reality, is neither more nor less than saying that more knowledge is better than less.


X.
The truth of this is sufficiently clear.


Y.
Every theory, therefore, the more general and comprehensive it is, the more valuable it is.


X.
Certainly.


Y.
The man whose mind contains the greatest number of general theories, is the man best furnished for correct practice; the man whose mind contains the smallest number the least.


X.
I see it is so.


Y.
The whole business of philosophy consists in the endeavour to render each theory as comprehensive as possible. The whole business of philosophy, therefore, is to furnish men as completely as possible for practice; and the best philosopher is by necessary consequence the best practitioner.


X.
It must be so, however wide of my former notions.


Y.
The evidence is irresistible. All practice proceeds upon the supposition of an ascertained sequence, meaning by sequence constancy of sequence. As far as the sequence is correctly ascertained, that is, as far as the theory goes, the practice founded on it is correct. Suppose a sequence in regard to the human body ascertained as far as the entire species is concerned, this collected information, or theory, is of far more importance than if the sequence had been traced as far only as men of a particular description. Suppose the sequence is next traced through horses: the theory is now enlarged, and is so much the more valuable. It would receive an additional value if the sequence were traced through another species and another; it would become exceedingly valuable if it were traced through all; and it would become the most valuable possible if the sequence were traced through all the objects of which our system is composed.


X.
It would so.


Y.
It thus appears, that the proper business of philosophy is to trace every sequence as far as possible, and ascertain its greatest extent. It is very often found that sequences, which at first view, Edition: current; Page: [232] appear to be different, and to constitute a variety of species, are, when more closely examined, found to be one. And it is not at all impossible, it is on the other hand very probable, that all the changes which we observe in this world, innumerable as they seem to be, may be the result of a small number of sequences, traceable through all terrestrial beings.


X.
I allow it all.


Y.
If philosophy shall ever discover these sequences, and it is making constant advances, all knowledge competent to human nature will be correctly summed up in a few propositions; and mistaken practice will be no longer possible.


X.
What a magnificent idea you present of the importance of theorizing, and what a revolution you have produced in my mind since our conversation began!


Y.
From this doctrine it is very difficult not to draw some practical conclusions.


X.
Why should we abstain from drawing those conclusions if we think they are of importance?


Y.
I am willing to give a specimen of them if you consent.


X.
I heartily consent.


Y.
We have seen that the language which contrasts theory and practice, setting the one above the other, is the very consummation of ignorance—that it proves a man to be unacquainted with the very first elements of thought, and goes a great way towards proving his mind to be so perverted as to be incapable of being taught them.


X.
It is impossible not to assent to this.


Y.
This appearing with a clearness and cogency of reason not inferior to demonstration, let us next turn our eyes upon a few historical facts. The language, demonstrative of this ignorance, has been a prevalent language in our two Houses of Parliament time out of mind. Our leaders in Parliament have always used it so profusely as if they did it in emulation of one another, and as a proof of their wisdom. We need not go too far back; let us begin with Pitt. It became a settled formula with him and his school. Fox was not behind him, in a nimble use of the same instrument; nor Windham, nor Grenville. Burke outran them all. Nor has there been any intermission. All the great men who have taken the lead in Parliament, from these men to the present, the greatest of all (the present are always the greatest), have been equally eager in the use of the same language, and have taken equal credit to themselves for the reach of mind which it displayed. History will find its advantage in this. It affords a measure of the men, perfectly accurate. They great men, who do not know the relation of theory to practice, and of practice to theory!
Another melancholy fact is, that this language, the offspring Edition: current; Page: [233] and display of the most deplorable ignorance, has always been peculiarly acceptable to the Members of both Houses of Parliament. They crow and look triumphant whenever they hear it. Whenever a great man gets up, and with a commanding voice and manner says, ‘Away with such or such a scheme of improvement! We will have no theories! Give us practice!’ the hear hims are more fervent than on almost any other occasion.
The Scripture tells us that on one occasion our Lord said, ‘My people perish for lack of knowledge.’ Well may this be said of the people of England, when their rulers in both Houses of Parliament have their heads in such a state.
The cry of practice against theory began to be used when the force of the cry against philosophy began to grow feeble, and it grew rife as the cry against philosophy died away.
The cry against philosophy was raised as soon as the eyes of the public began to be prying. There is never anything which needs amendment in the state, but there are numbers of men who see it is their interest to fight against the amendment; because they make their profit out of the abuse. All this disposition to pry into abuses was imputed to philosophy. If philosophy, that is, the disposition to inquire, could be successfully cried down, men would be quiet; and those good things which good men had so long enjoyed at the expense of others, would rest in peace. The clergy of such a church as the Church of England form the great section of the men who fight against amendment. Their establishment being altogether one overgrown abuse, a desperate attachment to abuses is a necessary part of their nature. Philosophy, therefore, they have always treated as their great enemy. Their accusations, like those of all impostors, are vague. Philosophy was very dangerous to men’s souls. The clergy are always remarkable for their care of men’s souls, when it is synonymous with care of their own interests. Philosophy being dangerous to men’s souls, God hates philosophers; and philosophers hate God. This foundation well laid, everything followed of course.
But men began to distrust the clergy. They found that philosophy was a thing originally of good repute. The highest eulogiums, and by the wisest men, had been bestowed upon it. Also, when they began to look into the thing itself, they could easily perceive that though there might be evil in it, there was also good. Men might be the better for it. What, then, could be the reason of the abhorrence of the clergy? That soon appeared. The light of philosophy made apparent the enormous abuses accumulated in such a thing as a corporation of priests set up with exorbitant wealth, and hence influence and power. The outcry against philosophy immediately lost a great share of its power, and the statesman needed a more usable instrument. Practice Edition: current; Page: [234] against theory was found very suitable to his purpose, and accordingly it superseded the other. Not but that a sneer at philosophy is still very acceptable to honourable and noble houses. To call a man a philosopher, in the way of contempt, is still sure of a cordial cheer; and it is probable that the two Houses of the British Legislature will be the last places on earth where, in an assembly of men pretending to be educated, philosophy will be treated with disrespect.
