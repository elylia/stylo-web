	If against the tracery of the rose windows at Ameins is in the most flamboyant possible style & exceedingly beautiful.  The inside dissapointed [sic] me, as in general the inside of of [sic] a Cathedral does after having looked long at the outside--one’s feelings have been raised & under no roof is their vastness to satisfy them.  It is however very fine--the altar & its accessories are wholly gilt & look more prosperous than usual with Catholic places, but in the whole beautiful building there is that confirmed air of thing & a system in a state of decadence which tho’ in itself always causing a first impression to melancholy, is on reflexion [sic] as much a subject of satisfaction morally as it is a source of Artistic beauty.  High mass was going on & the church was perhaps half filled by the usual attendants of such places, women & the poor.  The function of the Catholic religion which remains suitable to the wants of this time is its character of consolation to the victims of society & those classes are accordingly its nearly sole supporters & attendants.  How much I long to see noble buildings consecrated to nobler purposes than the repetition of old fables, whose old poetry does not make amends for the old coarseness gone by & mischievous moralities, nor the fine maxims of benevolent philosophy for its.  Catholicism has done immensely much for the world but it must give way to ideas at once more practical & more elevated.  Surely the unsuitability of any religion to its time is proved by the fact of its ministers not being the first people of their time, for the teachers & leaders should be the wisest & best a body of persons set in places of authority would be piety sure to be recognised as the highest spiritually if they were so.  The mass of the world appear to often have a mean jealousy of an individual superiority, but of large bodies occupying high places the tendency seems to be respect so long as their exists any however small claims to the feeling[.]  Mankind are both loyal & rebellious & either feeling is worked on by its suitable means.
