Both adherents and antagonists of Bentham’s general principles are accustomed to attribute to him the idea that all our notions are guided by self interest in a sense in which we think he never intended it to be taken or if he did which is by no means necessarily attached to it.  Our reason for thinking that he did not mean it is the sense usually given to it as a statement & defence [sic] of selfishness are twofold.  The one that his most peculiar principle which he endeavoured [sic] to formulise [sic] in the phrase ‘Greatest Happiness of the greatest number’ is in its spirit in direct contradition to the idea of personal selfishness.  The other that he did not at all assume to take[,]  moral philosophy still less the subtilties [sic] of metaphysical distinctions into account any further than absolutely necessary for the purpose of forming a political philosophy at a time when the science had scarcely begun to be recognized.  According to this definition self-interest must be all the feelings one self has--a conclusion evidently absurd. 
	We must in considering people’s interest take into account our own also--on what possible ground but that of the most sentimental absurdity are we to be interested for everybody except ourselves?  Keeping ever so closely to Bentham’s rule or to any other we must still ourself be counted for one?  we have the strongest objection to this sentimental morality because it can make & does make but two sorts of characters--good intentioned but hopelessly weak people, since nature will prend le dessus1 & if we have no interest in life but that of others we shall be wanting in all the strength which would enable us to do much good even to them, (& such are the characters which society has hitherto attempted & generally successfully to form in women). & thorough hypocrites or silent egotists2 & these are generally to be found among men for the reason that society allowing to them a cage large enough for short flights [so] they do not wound their wings at every attempt to expand them as women do against their gilded bars.3  
	Sentimentality is made to fill the place in the mind & feeling which must be filled somehow either well or ill in everyperson who is not a mere dry stick or machine a mâchoir[e] otherwise occupied by poetry or religion.  One does not wonder when one encounters persons in whom the finer instincts of the spiritual nature seen never to have existed or have never been awakened at the horror which persons of noble feelings but who dare not look nature & facts fully in the face lest they should not be beautiful feel at the thought of yeilding [sic] up their finest susceptabilities & lofty aspirations generous impulses devoted affections to the coarse handling of the unformed hand & narrow natures who are always the readiest to imagine they understand all subjects because they see none but those narrow & low ones ‘who runs may read’4  
	To make the practical business of life in which we include the external conduct of society in its largest sense the only rule & object of individual existence is to sacrifice the individual, & that is to say all individuals, to a confused idea of the whole.
