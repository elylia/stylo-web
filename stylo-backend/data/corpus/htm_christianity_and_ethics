Perhaps much of the reason why catholic countries have never succeeded in commerce like Protestant--or especially like England--is that catholicism takes--scarcely any, if indeed any, account of speaking the truth.  From this comes no feeling of dishonour in lying;  England’s great coml  proof must be attributed to the system of credit & this rests very much upon personal sense of dishonour in untruth.   England is the only country where it is universally felt to be an affront to doubt a person’s word.  I attribute this not so much to Protestantism wh[,] for ought I know[,] takes no particular note of this virtue, but to the accident of puritanism having adopted this fine principle, the purity & unselfishness of which suited well with the austerity of puritanism[.]  It is one of the many invaluable lessons left by Chivalry--we do not find it among the recommendations of Christianity.  Christianity avoided even by excess all the [public] virtues, probably because those held a high place in ancient ethics, while the benevolence was further inculcated by them & this virtue was most especially that of Christian character[.]
