If I could be allowed to be Providence to the world for a time, for the express object of raising the condition of women, I should come to you to know the means--the purpose would be to remove all interference with affection, or with any thing which is, or which might even be supposed to be, demonstrative of affection.  To state this opinion now, without preparing men for it by raising their moral natures would no doubt be mischievous--and the time when it shall be universally held, and beneficially too, seems so distant when one sees what men now are, that I am sometimes inclined to despair of it--but I do not despair.  If it is evident that all the best people one knows would be happier, and be the cause of more happiness to others (a necessary consequence of being themselves happy) by such a system[,] that is enough to keep alive the faith that such a time may come.
	I should think that 500 years hence, among the whole mass of absurdity by which former ages like to be remembered, there will be nothing which will so excite wonder and contempt as the fact of legislative interference in matters of feeling--or rather in the expressions of feeling.  It seems to me just as absurd that there should be legislation about marrying as about shaking hands.  When once the law undertakes to say which demonstration of feeling shall be given to which, it seems to me quite inconsistent not to legislate for all demonstrations of feeling and say how many may be touched, how many seen, how many heared [sic]--the Turks is the only consistent mode.
	When civilization was at so low a point as to make physical strength the foremost means of power I am surprised that men should have made any rules for their treatment of women.  there [sic] was the master and there the slave--perhaps they were in all respects property until some notion of religion came--but I am still more surprised that in the chivalrous times women did not attain immense powers in all matters whatever; when they had attained as much consideration as they had then, I wonder they did not gain so much more by their power to gratify the sensuality of men, combined with the absence of sensuality in their own nature. In a low state of moral feeling such as the present there is such a tremendous power which the women are certainly not at all too elevated to use, if they felt what a power it might be, for they do, now, live by the power, only they are content to put forth only so much of it as gains them bread, or a house, or a carriage, or whatever they find sufficient for their desires.  True, that they should know what a power this might be made is not desirable, because who would gain power by such means, is unfit for power; still as they do use this power for paltry advantages, I would rather if it must be used at all, that it were to gain some good purpose which should be a means to a better.
	But that the attachments of persons of different sex should be left perfectly unshackled, is only desirable in an educated community--no man of education more than any woman of education would derive pleasure from mere animal gratifications--there must be some mind
